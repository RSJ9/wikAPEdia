Someone asked me why staying delta neutral is better than just good ol fashioned stock value going up, to that i say: in a normal world (market) stock value just going up makes sense - but in this shady, loophole filled, corrupted, opaque, bought and paid for "free market" with the government body charged with looking over it apparently a revolving door for people having been in or heading for the financial industry and so partners in crime, that have been turning a major blind eye for a long time now which allowed this whole situation to happen in the first place - well normal rules don't apply.

The rules here are the short Hedgefunds get to dictate what happens to the price, they allow it to naturally rise a certain amount, then make money off their call options and then tank the price - via extra naked shorting, ETF shorting and *wash trading:*

Then when the price is tanked they make money off their put options, then allow the price to naturally rise again to a certain point, make money off their call options then tank it again, make money off their put options then let it rise again....... This is market manipulation to force profits off their ~~*delta*~~ *hedging* to try to generate some extra liquidity to help stall things out.

People talk about needing a catalyst for liftoff and they talk about Ryan Cohens options such as a Stock Split, Dividend Payout, Share Recall, Stockholder Meeting etc but here's one that doesn't get mentioned:

There is an ancient Ape saying "We can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent"

What's one thing better than just outlasting them and their solvency? Helping to reduce that solvency. how? By inflicting the aptly named *max pain theory* to counter their ~~*delta*~~ *hedging* - There's a reason we finished at just above 180 multiple times now and there's graphs showing our specific max pain point on GME currently and it's right around 175 - 185 (if anyone has that graph to contribute, or an updated/current one to add.)

Edit: <https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/GME>

(Look where the put and call options meet, where it basically makes the rest of the majority of calls and puts expire worthless.)

And we must be doing something right - because Citadel was already forced to make shitty rated BBB- bonds for 600m liquidation! so it turns out we really can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent especially when we drain them of that solvency! Get outplayed Kenny G!

So i know it's not the most exciting and perhaps even just a little bit worrying to some, but just know *we are sideways trading by design*, that *it's actually what we want*, that what "we're" (the long institutions are) doing is *helping to make Shorts bleed even more and force liftoff sooner than otherwise.*

Edit: Oh look, we traded completely sideways in After Hours market too. Know though, that strategies change as there's new developments every day, as well as reactions to previous strategies from both sides, not to mention that by now the Hedgies read all our top stuff and so know what we know, but we know they know what we know, even if they know we know they know what we know, you know? (teehee) So don't feel bad if things change (Again) as this thing is statistically inevitable, even declared by Gamestop themselves of there being over 100% short as well as a *very rare* short squeeze warning in their 10K - So it's just a matter of when, while enjoying the ride along the way - regardless of where that ride takes us along the way.

TL:DR sideways trading inflicts the *max pain theory* on short Hedgefunds, countering their ~~*delta*~~ *hedging* by keeping them ~~*delta*~~ *neutral* to make them bleed out even quicker, unable to profit off GME volatility via options both up and down, each swing.
