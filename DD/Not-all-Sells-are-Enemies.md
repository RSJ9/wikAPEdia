From me - I just thought this should be reposted cause the first post didn't gain much traction and he turned out to be within closing price of 30 cents.

This is WuzGoodieN1gz ( original dd: <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m33en4/not_all_calls_are_friendlies> ) posting through a proxy ape: [/u/beowulf77](https://www.reddit.com/u/beowulf77/)

First of all, I want to apologize to [/u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/) and [/u/heyitspixel](https://www.reddit.com/u/heyitspixel/) because I realize now you are not hedgie shills and I was a bit harsh. Also, I was wrong about this week and want to clarify my new position on what's actually happening. Let's get to the sauce:

In the same way not all calls are friendlies, not all sells/puts/borrowed shares/ETF breakdowns are enemies. It is my belief that the long whales have been selling, borrowing shares, and cashing in on put positions since my last post. Why?? When you are at a poker table it is a well-known strategy if the table is passive you should be aggressive and if the table is aggressive you should be passive. I believe that the shorts placed TONS of call options last wednesday which was the ensuing battle. But they didn't just place those calls for last friday... They also placed them for the week of the MOASS predicted by Pixel (don't hand your playbook to the enemy). This is why hedgies hide their positions from each other. Our whales have crafted a brilliant strategy: they are dumping their shares to us apes and borrowing all ETF/short shares to completely eradicate the enemies ammunition.

Any MM can borrow shares to short. Any MM can breakdown ETFs for shares. What if our long whales were doing just that - to absolutely fuck over the shorts when we start the squeeze and for them to be unable to create a ceiling. They have run to the ammunition depot and bought all the fucking clips. This is the perfect game theory response to the shorts tanking price and buying a fuck ton of calls. They don't have the options positions to push the price down further and all their ammunition is being stolen/used by our long whales. I believe our long whales trust us apes so fucking much they are dumping their shares to us to prepare the liquidity for the MOASS. If I'm correct it means the shorts will HAVE NOTHING TO PREVENT OUR RAPID ASCENT TO ALPHA CENTAURI. Buy the fucking dip, hodl, and most importantly know that there are great forces committed to bringing us across the finish line. We are with you.

The reason they are selling shares into the apes is to provide liquidity for their final run to the outer edges of the universe. They need to be able to blow past sell walls and really high price numbers. They will have more than enough shares they need the cash to stop the ceilings/shorts/sell walls.

I come from an old blood line of WSBers so I'm going to post my position because "Position or Ban" 4900 shares @ 110 average

I do not think its a good idea for ANYONE ELSE to post positions this is more anecdotal and to be transparent about me being DEEP LONG

I think we finish tomorrow @ 195-199 to avoid the enemies 200c and we start a run monday.

3/19 EOD Update:

Citadel/Susquehanna has bigger guns because of order flow.

They are using retail buys/sells to manipulate bell prices and they have bigger guns than our long whales, but our whales took all the ammo.

No borrowable shares left.
