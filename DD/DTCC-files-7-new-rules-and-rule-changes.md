# The DTCC just filed 7 new rules and rule changes with the SEC for 4-7-21.... Several have to do with option trading.

Could use some wrinkly brained apes to decode and let us know of this helps us at all. /u/Leaglese usually does a fantastic job!

Edit: Misspelled Legaleseâ€™s username. Fixed.

Proposed NYSE change: change to the way the NBBO is calculated, which is snooze for GME purposes.

CORRECTION: on looking at another post this may be way more juicy than my skim intended, may include dark pools and OTC prices in calculating the NBBO, worth a look!

Proposed ICE change: honestly this is out of my wheelhouse as it relates to credit default swaps, so I'd need to take time to do more research

Proposed BZE change: this is quite juicy, seems to want to put a limit on the number of strikes for short term options, may be worth looking into

Proposed CBOE change: same as above, just different exchange

Proposed MEMX change: to extend a pilot program till October 21 relating to 'clearly erroneous executions', again probably worth a look

Proposed NASDAQ BX change: proposal to improve its display of what the highs, lows and close price of a security was for that day

Proposed NASDAQ PHLX change: same as above, different exchange

Please note this is a 5 minute skim of each doc as I'm knee deep in my new DD and unfortunately can't spare the time to look in great detail, hope this helps though
