Fellow Apes, you may remember me from my post on Friday analyzing¬†[why hedge funds couldn't have repositioned on the 28th, and why they couldn't have covered on the 29th](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/?ref=share&ref_source=link). My post gained a lot of interest and I am glad you all appreciated my analysis.ü¶ç

Last night something interesting was brought to my attention, and I think you guys might want to take a look. After the post gained popularity on the 6th, Fintel significantly altered their short volume data.üöÄ

As you can see, they changed the data, seemingly for no reason, on the 7th. What's interesting is that all of short volume data specifically was REDUCED BY HALF

I was curious if this was simply a normal thing for them to do, to alter data randomly on weekends, so I checked Tesla data to see if it was also reduced.¬†It was not.

As you can see, all of the GME short volume data was reduced by half on the 7th, but none of the TSLA data was reduced. Why would that be?

Well, the same thing was done for AMC.

AMC reduced by 50%

But not for Apple

Honestly, all I can say is¬†very sloppy Fintel, very sloppy.

We caught you with your hand in the cookie jar, and now we know that you and likely several other financial intelligence sources are manipulating data.

I guess the analysis from my original post was pretty spot on for you guys to go and start altering all of the data. Fortunately, I always keep the receipts.

Why would hedge funds be going nuclear with media FUD, disinformation campaigns and bots? Why would seemingly reliable sources of financial data be altering specific data for tickers that gain public attention? Why do they need you to believe that they covered?

Thank you to¬†[/u/moo-va-long](https://www.reddit.com/u/moo-va-long/)¬†for bringing this to my attention.

Here are some additional sources of people talking about this,¬†[1](https://youtu.be/uJuHEsemSqo),[2](https://twitter.com/TradesTrey/status/1358620225500020740?s=19)

TLDR: Just read it guys, this one was quick. Fintel was caught red handed altering their short volume data for stocks like GME and AMC, but not for stocks like TSLA and AAPL. I have provided the receipts and it is clear what they have done. Think critically about every piece of data you come across, because they are trying to cover their tracks, start keeping your receipts.
