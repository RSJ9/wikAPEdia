[DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

So yesterday I posted about FINRA ADF showing up as the primary exchange for GME trades over the past 6 trading days (and likely much longer). The thing is, FINRA ADF is not currently in operation...

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/muzj4o/finra_webmaster_no_brokerdealers_currently_using/>

[u/koreanjc](https://www.reddit.com/u/koreanjc/) had a great post about this a little over a week ago [FADF - A Dark Pool](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpebkz/sells_through_the_major_exchanges_buys_through/)

While looking into this, I realized that the GME Bloomberg Terminal data is missing between 31.4% and 38.9% of GME daily trading volume from 4/13 - 4/20.

That's 19,411,389 missing bananas over just 6 trading days. Only 70 million GME-issued bananas are supposed to exist...

If you add up the total missing volume + ADF volume, you will see that over 69% of GME bananas are being reported as trading off exchange (FINRA ADF, which is reportedly not in operation - again see my post from yesterday), or completely missing (a deeper, darker pool that even Bloomberg can't see?).

40,126,778 GME bananas were traded over 6 days, and even Bloomberg, which costs $24,000/year, has no idea where they are.

I'm not a finance guy, or a stock guy - I'm an ape. I can't really do math, but luckily Excel does the math for me.

I don't play options, but if I had call options for 4/16 or 4/23, which are each worth thousands and thousands of dollars, I would certainly want to know what unknown entity is keeping the price of GME at this $160 threshold by hiding 40,126,778 bananas from making their way to the exchanges.

TLDR - each day, over 69% of GME bananas are either missing, or being routed through "FINRA ADF", which is not currently operating. Someone is hiding your GME bananas to artificially manipulate the GME stock price from mooning. The rocket is fueled for take-off. Can anyone find out what is going on with the missing bananas?

Data from Bloomberg vs Actual Daily Volume. So many missing bananas...

Edit 1: Daily GME Volume

Source: nasdaq.com. Why is the actual daily volume so much different than reported Bloomberg volume? Where are the missing bananas?

Edit 2: Edited the Excel sheet to reflect the Nasdaq daily volume (I had used a different source, which had slightly different Total Volume data).

The total missing bananas increased from 19,285,389 to 19,411,389. Also edited the missing banana data for each Bloomberg terminal to reflect Nasdaq. Thanks [u/2008UniGrad](https://www.reddit.com/u/2008UniGrad/)

Edit 3: Added Bloomberg Terminal from 4/21 (below) and added updated Excel sheet to reflect 4/21 data (also below). Updated total missing bananas to reflect 4/21 data.

Total missing bananas for last 7 trading days = 20,798,855 bananas

Total missing bananas + ADF for last 7 trading days = 42,644,089 bananas

Data from Bloomberg vs Actual Daily Volume. Added 4/21 data to running total from last 7 trading days.
