happy monday you crayon sucking simians.

i spent the night collecting the most up to date GME holdings among ETFs with >10k shares of GME. i included GAMR because up until recently they did have more than 10k shares.

here's the pie chart [link](https://imgur.com/0N6gGmf) and the spreadsheet with sources [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SWK2krtYHqrGu222bVGhRwTP9niW-0t-_9Bbpwru3jY/edit?usp=sharing).

in total ETFs currently hold ~15.8M shares. ~~if you take the current reported float of GME to be ~45.16M shares (reported 12/31/20 to the SEC) that would be around 35%~~ Current float of GME is ~54.17M shares as reported by GameStop on their [website](https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/fundamentals/trading-statistics).

this post is primarily a data dump for others to use for future analysis.

stay tuned for a follow on post regarding FTD and short interest for the same ETFs with my own analysis.
