TLDR;¬†ETFs are continuing to BUY and HOLD.

3 months ago, on 19 Mar, I created a spreadsheet that tracked the holdings reports of the top 30+ ETFs that hold GME. Today I revisited that spreadsheet and updated the numbers with current reporting. The biggest updates came from Vanguard who published their quarterly holdings update at the end of April. Unlike the other tracked ETFs, Vanguard does not post daily holdings reports. Here are my findings.

Total share count amongst the 32 tracked ETFs increased from 11.7 Million to 13.0 Million (+10.6%). Vanguard specifically had an increase in GME holdings from 3.7 Million to 4.8 Million (+30%).

This increase in position comes with an increase in stock price. On 19 Mar, GME closed at $200.27. On 4 Jun it closed at $248.36. This shows that as a whole, ETFs have increased their total stake in GME and these changes were not due to adjustments from price alone.
