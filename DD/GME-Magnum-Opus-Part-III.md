Good morning Apes, Uncle Hank is back with another episode of the Magnum Opus. On today's episode: will my wife ever stop fucking the mailman? (Spoiler: NOPE).

I wasn't originally planning on making these daily but because there has been such a great reaction and many of you have asked me, I will continue to make these daily, with updates, until the theory is proven wrong or until we go to tendietown. I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.

Before reading this, you MUST¬†[read my first post (most important)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtf4e4/gme_magnum_opus_dd_past_present_future/)and¬†[my second post (update based on yesterday's price action](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu1esp/gme_magnum_opus_update_theory_confirmation_today/)). If you don't read those you WILL NOT understand wtf I am babbling on about. Now, I present to your: Uncle Hank's Magnum Opus: ROUND 3:

Quick Summary of where we are based on the theory

If you've already read the other two posts, skip to the part where I say you have a nice cock (you do btw).

My theory said that because of similar price trends that I have detailed in my first post, GME is currently repeating its price and volume pattern from early January. My reasoning for this is because the shorts have been in a nasty FTD cycle for over a year, so that's why we see similarities in price. As I've said many times, THIS IS JUST A THEORY, I could very well be wrong, so please do not take this as fact. As soon as there is a major sign that the theory is wrong, I will let you know immediately.

GME price and volume action from 12/28-1/8 and 4/5 - 4/16:

From this information, my theory predicted that GME would have a significant gap up yesterday with volume higher than the previous Thursday and Friday just as it did on 1/11. That seems to have happened. Here is a comparison of yesterday to 1/11:

Yesterday:

[![r/Superstonk - GME Magnum Opus theory: Round 3](https://preview.redd.it/cord4l0gvdu61.png?width=2206&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6bf34fd8e7135209e6ad1a19b3b1fbc7fef515f)](https://preview.redd.it/cord4l0gvdu61.png?width=2206&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6bf34fd8e7135209e6ad1a19b3b1fbc7fef515f)

1/11:

[![r/Superstonk - GME Magnum Opus theory: Round 3](https://preview.redd.it/mnjki4devdu61.png?width=2204&format=png&auto=webp&s=70268505248438fb978e306abf182e435dd0b579)](https://preview.redd.it/mnjki4devdu61.png?width=2204&format=png&auto=webp&s=70268505248438fb978e306abf182e435dd0b579)

Interestingly, both of these days, the price shot up in premarket, gapped up from the previous Friday price, had super high volume in the beginning of the day, volume and price then faded the rest of the day, and volume, though higher than the previous two days, was nothing special. Yesterday's IV crush hurt my calls more than my wife's boyfriend hurt me when I forgot to pay his rent 8 months in advance.

If you've read my other two posts start here (nice cock btw):

[![r/Superstonk - GME Magnum Opus theory: Round 3](https://preview.redd.it/ribvsz3lvdu61.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=715164eec106767d68125c9420216cf6f112e884)](https://preview.redd.it/ribvsz3lvdu61.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=715164eec106767d68125c9420216cf6f112e884)

Alright, so if the theory is correct, today should be a flat day, slightly negative, with very low volume and no significant price movements on the up or downside other than a slight dip after open. I want to be very clear that because today's price action is predicted to be absolutely nothing special that today's price and volume being in line with 1/12 does not prove that the theory is correct, it simply doesn't prove that it isn't correct. The reason for that is because it's very hard to infer a correlation from a flat price and low volume. As I've said before, Wednesday will be the real test. If today the price goes super high or low or if volume exceeds yesterday then the theory is probably incorrect (and I will tell you all this). However, if we have a flat day, then the theory has not been proven incorrect.

1/12 Price action and volume:

[![r/Superstonk - GME Magnum Opus theory: Round 3](https://preview.redd.it/4l33qrypvdu61.png?width=2212&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a7351370beb53e86b48a2a9aa9a9840f90cb9a)](https://preview.redd.it/4l33qrypvdu61.png?width=2212&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a7351370beb53e86b48a2a9aa9a9840f90cb9a)

This low volume, flat but maybe slightly negative price, with a possible dip in the early morning, and maybe a pickup in volume towards EOD is what we are looking to follow today. So if you're sad about a boring day today, at least you can know that Uncle Hank may be on to something (last time I thought I was on to something is when I caught my wife with the mailman for the first time, sooooooooooo).

1/13 Price action and volume:

As I said before, Wednesday is the important day. This is not GME moon day. This is HomeDepotHank69 theory come true or not day (I know, very catchy). It's important to note that HomeDepotHank69 theory come true or not day is just a stepping stone to GME moon day and GME moon day will be much bigger. If we see similar price and volume action tomorrow as we did on 1/13, then that is further confirmation of my theory. If this does happen, I will make a mega magnum opus post that details where that puts us for the next few weeks regarding this theory. In the meantime, here is the price action and volume of 1/13 (our day to look at tomorrow):

[![r/Superstonk - GME Magnum Opus theory: Round 3](https://preview.redd.it/4xvz81sqvdu61.png?width=2214&format=png&auto=webp&s=3839c30e38e5fa13e1777763a181965e125370f9)](https://preview.redd.it/4xvz81sqvdu61.png?width=2214&format=png&auto=webp&s=3839c30e38e5fa13e1777763a181965e125370f9)

What's interesting about this is that there is no movement in the premarket hours and the giant move upward comes starting around 10am and peaks around 11am. As a student of GME I've long noticed that GME's peak up or down is either before 10am or around 11am, so just something to keep in mind. I'm getting ahead of myself, let's focus on today and see if it looks similar to 1/12.

Looking to the future:

Apes, I know that the plethora of charts and colors may confuse you (if you are color blind, I will set you up with my wife's boyfriend immediately), so here is a longer view so you can see where we are and where we may be going according to the theory. According to the theory, everything to the left of the red line has already happened (this is early January). Everything left of the line is up to 1/11. Everything to the right of the line has not happened yet. Today, we are looking to follow that very tiny red candle with little volume, then Wednesday, we are looking to follow that explosive green candle with volume bigger than my wife's body count. Again, this is just a theory, do not take it as fact. As soon as I see evidence that the theory is wrong, I will update this. Here is the chart:

[![r/Superstonk - GME Magnum Opus theory: Round 3](https://preview.redd.it/epcufzjtvdu61.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dcb21833b58fcf1a8691f7c87bc0a3ba64a24a3)](https://preview.redd.it/epcufzjtvdu61.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dcb21833b58fcf1a8691f7c87bc0a3ba64a24a3)

Ignore those two white lines. STAY STRONG APES.

EDIT 1: only about 50k in volume by 9am, seems like it's gonna be a low volume day.

EDIT 2: extremely low volume at open, price slightly negative

EDIT 3: Volume still low, price still slightly negative. Just like 1/12, the dip peaked around 10am, will we recover the rest of the day like on 1/12?

EDIT 4: Shoutout to¬†[u/SpecialEditionDVD](https://www.reddit.com/u/SpecialEditionDVD/)¬†for this great comment:

Second, I'm very curious about this theory and think you are on to something:

-   The jump from 1/10 to 1/11 was ~230% and the jump from 4/16 to 4/19 was ~200%.

-   On 1/11, volume was 14.9M. On 1/12, volume was 7.1M (roughly 48% of the previous day).

-   Yesterday's volume was 10.5M, so I'm thinking the range should be in the 4.5-5.5M range.

EDIT 5: still LOW ASS volume. Price is declining more than 1/12, but on 1/12 we did see a big dip in the morning. If we keep dipping lower, the theory may be in jeopardy. I will continue to update.

EDIT 6: Ouchy price go down ouch. Theory is not looking good today in terms of price but it is looking good in terms of volume. If we end closer to VWAP or end down less than 5%, I'll feel better about the theory. Stay tuned for more updates and for tomorrow's post.

EDIT 7: Thank you so much to¬†[u/nuulss](https://www.reddit.com/u/nuulss/)¬†for talking about T+21. This is further reason why I thought that the price of GME was repeating becuase of the "nasty FTD cycle." I am going to do more research on that tonight and will hopefully be able to include an extensive amount of it in tomorrow's post. Thank you so much to¬†[u/nuulss](https://www.reddit.com/u/nuulss/)¬†for mentioning that, ur sexy as hell.

EDIT 8: fellow ape¬†[u/wwalley](https://www.reddit.com/u/wwalley/)¬†came to the same conclusion as me, go show him some love

EDIT 9: Fixed pictures

FINAL EDIT: Below is a comparison of today's price action and volume with 1/12. We closed the day at 158.53. There are definitely some differences here, but for the most part it's similar. A big difference is that 1/12 stayed mostly around the VWAP. Contrastingly, today we were under it for most of the day. another difference is that our morning dip was much more severe than 1/12 and we didn't recover from it like 1/12. There are many similarities. however. Both days we had far below 10m volume. Both days were not very volatile and saw IV drop throughout the day. The high of both days was near open and there was a dip in the early morning. Interestingly, on both days volume really ramped up in the last 15 minutes of trading and price did as well. IMO, volume, shape of the charts, and the last 15 minutes of trading are the biggest similarities. Overall, I see no reason as to why the theory is wrong, however, as I said before, today does absolutely nothing to prove that the theory is correct. Today, simply gives no evidence that it was wrong. As I said, tomorrow is HomeDepotHank69 theory come true or not day. See the above chart on 1/13 for a comparison as to where we should go tomorrow. If we do not have a significant ramp up in volume and price, my theory was wrong and I will notify you all. If we do, I probably won't leave my house for several days. I will be making another post tomorrow for the theory and am also going to try and do more research concerning¬†[u/nuulss](https://www.reddit.com/u/nuulss/)¬†comment about T+21 expiration and see if I can find any similarities there. In the meantime, stay strong apes. Not financial advice, not a financial advisor.

One more edit cuz fuck me:

Anyone else think the after hours activity is looking similar to 1/12? After hours aren't the best thing to consider because of the fact that the price can be moved really easily due to the low volume, but wow they're looking similar right about now.
