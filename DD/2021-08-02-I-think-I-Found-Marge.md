EDIT: Some nice pre-reads by [u/PWNWTFBBQ](https://www.reddit.com/u/PWNWTFBBQ/) who somehow managed to (in my opinion) solve GME and provide apes with the secret sauce.

Too bad no one's noticed so far lol. In the second part/post she made, she somehow came up with the SLD dates as bullish dates and August as a bullish as fuck month and didn't really know what an SLD was. Anyway, she used pure math to derive what look like the SLD dates i'm showing in this post which is nuts.

GME's Highs and Close Prices

Here's GME's chart displaying the HIGH and CLOSE prices.

GME's Highs and Close Prices During an SLD Deposit Period

Here's the same chart but this time only showing the HIGH and CLOSE price for the 2 days of the monthly SLD Deposit Period.

[![r/Superstonk - I think i found marge](https://preview.redd.it/pwrfc9gv0ye71.png?width=1765&format=png&auto=webp&s=c764f4066cf38ed90e3c7c605a5a826de3bd98ec)](https://preview.redd.it/pwrfc9gv0ye71.png?width=1765&format=png&auto=webp&s=c764f4066cf38ed90e3c7c605a5a826de3bd98ec)

The monthly SLD Deposit Period is:

-   The 3'rd Friday of every month & the 2 days before it.

During these 2 days, the top 30 largest NSCC members must deposit a *fuckton of money TO the NSCC.

*Fuckton: The largest amount of money they've had to deposit to the NSCC within the last 24 months. E.g JANUARY's HUGE SLD.

Notice that within the periods above, GME has never closed above $230'ish.

GME High and Close Prices During Monthly Option Expiry Period

Here's the same chart but this time only showing the HIGH and CLOSE price for the 3 days of the Monthly Option Expiry Period.

[![r/Superstonk - I think i found marge](https://preview.redd.it/lfls1dnt0ye71.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=341021906816f60a69bd098e29cab48209d1d475)](https://preview.redd.it/lfls1dnt0ye71.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=341021906816f60a69bd098e29cab48209d1d475)

The monthly Monthly Option Expiry Period is:

-   The 3'rd Friday of every month until the next Tuesday.

During this time, the NSCC processes / Nets / Uses CNS (Continuous Netting System) using the previously deposited SLD to net each NSCC participant's monthly option liabilities.

Notice that within the periods above, GME has never closed above $230'ish.

GME High and Close Prices During SLD Effect Period

Here's the same chart but this time only showing the HIGH and CLOSE price for the 6 days of the SLD Effect Period.

[![r/Superstonk - I think i found marge](https://preview.redd.it/wjyvbsus0ye71.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c872c46dc6e0fedb5a2796bec31702746d2b42)](https://preview.redd.it/wjyvbsus0ye71.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c872c46dc6e0fedb5a2796bec31702746d2b42)

The SLD Effect Period is:

-   The 6 business/trading days that come AFTER the Tuesday (Last day of the Monthly Options Expiration Period).

During this period, the effects of the NSCC's netting using the SLD become apparent in the market. Keep in mind that during this period, the NSCC still HOLDS the NSCC Participant's SLD for use in CNS / Netting.

Notice that within the periods above, GME has never closed above $250'ish.

GME High and Close Prices During SLD Return Period

Here's the same chart but this time only showing the HIGH and CLOSE price for the 1 day that the NSCC returns the SLD to the participant OR asks for more cash to Net / CNS / Clear option trades. (Marge)

[![r/Superstonk - I think i found marge](https://preview.redd.it/gljnzjpo0ye71.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb3bf806ef02c36ab73987fa657c29958885969)](https://preview.redd.it/gljnzjpo0ye71.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb3bf806ef02c36ab73987fa657c29958885969)

The SLD Return Period is:

-   The 7'th business/trading days that come AFTER the Tuesday (Last day of the Monthly Options Expiration Period).

On this date, the NSCC returns the SLD that was given to them by the NSCC participant/member.

In the case that the SLD was not enough to clear that month's trades (e.g the OCC reported average monthly trades were way above the norm), then the NSCC (also known as DTCC) may call the participant/member and request for an additional SLD (Supplementary Liqudiity Deposit).

This is also known as marge.

Please notice the highs and closing prices for GME during these SLD return (or marge) periods. I clearly see the 28'th (which is an SLD return period btw) as the date where marge called and then the frantic attempt to drop the price below the marge threshold.

*Notice:* Look at the Highs/Closes at which the prices gets rejected. ($230 and then consequently $260).

Notice: The Jan 28 frantic attempt for the price to close below these certain price ranges.

Conclusion

Make your own conclusion as to where and when marge lies, but i'm gonna say that my own conclusion for marge to be achieved is that for marge to be achieved, the following requirements must be met:

GME must close above $260 during August 20 to Sept 2 or significantly above it for marge confirmation.

Also according to the last chart, it looks like the ceiling is increasing with each quarter end so i'm going to assume that this quarter's ceiling is either still at $260 OR that it's increased to $320 and that based on that we may need to close above $320 during the above specified period in order for marge for be met and confirmed.

Call me Jack because i'm your tits.
