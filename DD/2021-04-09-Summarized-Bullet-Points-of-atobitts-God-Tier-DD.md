To whom it may concern,

The following represents a summarized narrative from my works cited below. I write out of concern for the continuity of our financial system. Most importantly, to illustrate the injustice that it allows.

-   Hedge funds and offshore entities are¬†*NOT*¬†required to disclose most of their financial information- including short positions

-   Citadel Securities is a market-maker for Citadel Advisors (hedge fund). They are considered a significant player within their environment. Citadel Securities has registered with the SEC and FINRA since 2002

-   Investors rely on the SEC and FINRA to make sure these entities are not adversely affecting our markets, which are heavily regulated

-   However, since 2006, FINRA has caught Citadel Securities breaking the rules in 60 separate events. Here are the facts:

    -   There is an event for almost every year since 2006

    -   Several violations span multiple years, with just¬†1¬†written violation

    -   The phrase¬†*"without admitting or denying"*¬†appears 123 times¬†on a¬†[182 page PDF](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_116797.pdf)

    -   The phrase¬†*"failed to"*¬†appears 218 times. Here are 4:

        -   FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE

        -   FAILED TO IDENTIFY A SHORT SALE INDICATOR

        -   FAILIED TO DISPLAY CERTAIN OTC CUSTOMER ORDERS

        -   FAILED TO CLOSE OUT A FAIL TO DELIEVER

    -   The word¬†*"prevent"*¬†appears 102 times.¬†Mostly in statements such as:

        -   PREVENT THE EXECUTION OR DISPLAY OF SHORT SALE ORDERS

        -   NO SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE ENTRY OF ERRONEOUS ORDERS

        -   RISK CONTROLS FAILED TO DETECT AND PREVENT

    -   On March 25th, 2021 CITADEL RECEIVED A NEW CITATION FOR:

        -   "unintentionally" reporting internal transfers as normal securities transactions. This constituted 14% of all reported transactions

It is apparent that the disciplinary actions- often a small fee- are not adequate to prevent this type of behavior. Furthermore, they have become a cost of doing business as is apparent through the company's indifference in admitting or denying the action.

As a citizen of the United States and direct participant within the US stock market, I demand the SEC explain¬†*WHY*¬†these actions are being tolerated.
