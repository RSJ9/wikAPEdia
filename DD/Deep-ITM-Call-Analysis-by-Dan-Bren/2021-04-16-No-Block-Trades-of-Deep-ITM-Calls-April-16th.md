GME Biggest Trades 4-18-2021

As you can see from the image above there were no large block trades of DEEP ITM calls. I think this is likely a result of this being the expiration date of the DEEP ITM calls that were being traded. If you look back at my prior posts you can see that almost every large block trade of DEEP ITM calls were dated for 4/16/21. Seeing as they would be extra volatile on their last day it would make sense why Hedgies wouldn't want to trade them (although DEEP ITM calls have very little theta a.k.a. time value decay). I will be curious to see if these start up again with an expiration on the next large quarterly options date (something like 7/16/21) or if these will disappear entirely. As always I will keep you posted. See you tomorrow.

I may need to invest in Crayola at the end of all this. My Red addiction is getting the best of me.
