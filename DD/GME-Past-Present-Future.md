Greetings apes. This DD compares several different time frames of GME's past price and volume to now to show similarities, where we currently are in relation to historical prices, and where we could go. This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

EDIT: before you read this, this is NOT a prediction, this is just a comparison of the past to now to show where we COULD be going. Stock price action often repeats itself but this is not a guarantee or prediction by any means.

The big view

This chart gives you an overview of the time frames I will be comparing. I will first be comparing the red and green squares to show that they are extremely similar in price action and volume. After that, I will be analyzing the blue square to demonstrate where we could be going in the next days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares share extremely similar price and volume action:

Where we've been vs. where we are (red and green square comparison):

Color-coded explanation for the above two charts:

As you can see, the similarities are uncanny. The volume patterns are identical, the two peaks follow the same pattern, the first peak is lower than the second but has higher volume, the second peak is immediately followed by a rapid drop in price, and the reaction to earnings and eventual recovery are extremely similar.

Where we could be going

The below chart is the blue square in the large-view chart. This represents where we could be going in the coming days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares that I compared are extremely similar. It follows that because the red and green squares are so similar and this blue square follows the red square, we could see similar price action to this square in the future. This indicates that we still have a few more days/weeks to go before the actual squeeze but that we should see a substantial increase in price very soon. Is this a guarantee? Not at all! This is simply using past data to make a prediction about the future. We very well could see the squeeze sooner or later than what this predicts!

There you have it! According to historical similarities in GME's price movements, we are in for a substantial increase in price in the coming days, we will then see a consolidation period, we will then see a monstrous jump followed by a slight consolidation, then the squeeze will take us to tendie town. The differences in these squares are that (obviously) the current price is about 10x higher than the previous price, however, they still follow a similar pattern. Though the price action is similar, this current pattern (green) seems to be moving quicker than the past pattern (red). If, in the coming days/weeks, GME's price and volume are similar to the blue square, that indicates that we should be on deck for the MOASS and, because the current price is substantially higher than the past price, this squeeze will be SIGNIFICANTLY larger in price. Again, do not take this as a fact, this simply uses historical price and volume to give a picture of where we COULD be going.

TL;DR

The current GME volume and price action follows pre-January trends extremely similarly. Using the past to predict the future, we should see a substantial jump soon followed by consolidation, followed by a monstrous jump, followed by consolidation, and then the tendie squeeze. Again, this is not a guarantee, this is a potential scenario based on past similarities to know.
