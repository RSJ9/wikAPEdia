Whats up fellow degenerates?!

I hate that you people make me do this but¬†TL;DR¬†- CTA, ICE, Banks, FINRA, Fed, money printer go brrr, and we are all living in a simulated pyramid scheme.

Another crazy week and it isn't even over yet. Looks like the DD and everything else we are seeing seems to be actually real (kind of fucked up, I know, our confirmation biases are off the chart, especially after reading buttfarm69s crazy fucking DD earlier. And obviously HOC2 and 3 have been an eye opener for how FINRA "governs" all the data reporting).

I'm back with another hypothetical, philosophical, technical evidence based, adderall fueled erection, DD. I wanted to post this a while ago and just waited because we are all just kind of sick of reading. But here's some confirmation about time travel and how our favorite GME investor(s) might be coming from the future. I hadn't even posted this yet and Cohen came out with how we were all feeling when this started going up again (boner city amirite?).

Hehehehe it's big right? I saw this at my buddies 3 weeks ago and thought of all of us, but had to wait. It wasn't right yet. It is now right.

Anyway. Theres a real DD encased in this rocketship flying hard-on; it's all about how the crazy pyramid scheme we live in creates an illusion like we should just be born, work, retire for a couple years, and die. The circle of life right? Wrong mother fucker. We should be able to enjoy the little things in life like watching our kids grow up, or staying healthy and feeling great, or doing a bunch of blow out of a strippers crack -- whatever you want really. Yet here we are. 300k of us (120k degenerates online not working clearly) slaving away hoping there's more to life. And yes, it takes a village and different facets of society to succeed, but people should do what they love, and finding out how they can succeed and actually benefit society would be better than sticking them in a corner because we don't really care or because a billionaire needs another yacht. But, I digress. We want to change the world but chances are our tendies will just help to innovate and¬†*hopefully*¬†change things for the better. There are still going to be corners of the world that have to carve giant flying dick rockets to survive. So barring that, are we going to change the world? Or just change those in control of the status quo? Ill leave that for you to decide because what I have figured out is just a round about way of saying how fucked we all are even after this moons, because we have been borrowing from our collective future in this capitalistic world for far too long (MMT). I'm greedy too so I don't really care. I just don't want to get up at 5 or 6am anymore.

Lets get started instead of going though some philosophical debate about ourselves hey? Ok. Fuck you too.

You wanted some mind-bending drugs to help wrap your head around this gongshow of an illusion we're in?

Well, I don't have any, I only have data and the greatest pyramid/ponzi scheme ever sold (I'm going to use these interchangeably, because its almost pretty much the same - one you buy in and sell to others [like when I tell people I just like any stock], and the other, you buy in and get paid with promises from someone else's deposit [exactly what is happening with GME from our hedgefuck friends], zero sum game and someone loses).

Once I wrote a DD on how we actually get the data from Yahoo, or Nasdaq, etc. I guess until now I never really realized how important that data was. If you did, congrats and fuck you, where's the DD? Seriously, post it Ill read it. In all seriousness I haven't seen too many mentions of these guys.

Anyway, I decided again we need to start hunting for that full process. Because now more than ever, we are being told that data is popping up as "Just a bug, bro". This term seems to be used as an old school trader term, "oh it's just a glitch" was a comment made when something happened that you couldn't explain, because chances are it was a competitor fucking you in the ass or getting a jump on you. I can tell you right now, risk and compliance guys (lawyers and adjusters), don't fuck around. If it can cause issues in underlying code, it won't exist for long. In fact, most of what I'm about to show you is rigorously tested before you're allowed to be an exchange at market. I can say that because if you comb through the technical documents, you'll see that FINRA is the main factor here. And honestly I am thinking we should build the A.P.E. (Ape Penis Exchange) Exchange. Yes, exchange should be included twice to get across how retarded we are.

Your knowledge about the market is about to change forever. Because (and I quote myself here), I'm about to blow your mind like our moms should have done to our Dads instead of letting him finish inside her and bringing us into this clown world pyramid scheme.

We've been seeing a lot about NBBO and what it means to the surrounding price that we see placed into the market. And here is where the CTA comes into play.

[![r/Superstonk - It's Just a Pyramid Scheme Part 2: The Top of the Pyramid](https://preview.redd.it/wdqt37wd6r171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ae9086c0ff19684275630f467a0fd846f07788a)](https://preview.redd.it/wdqt37wd6r171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ae9086c0ff19684275630f467a0fd846f07788a)

Basically, anything that has to do with the NYSE, flows through the CTA. NASDAQ gets that data, your broker gets that data, Shitadel gets that data, IEX gets that data, etc. and they all disseminate it accordingly. Based on the wording, I do not believe the "central consolidator" is a separate entity, just a platform that gives us the CTS and CQS. Although, based on HOC yesterday, it is entirely plausible that it is FINRA. Lol. And they mostly capture that data because if you look at the tape corrections in May, they JUST updated some Jan 29 info for GME.

This data effectively gives us the ability to calculate the NBBO, and they make the decisions to halt. Thanks, FINRA.

"National Best Bid and Offer is a regulation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that requires brokers to execute customer trades at the best available (lowest) ask price when buying securities, and the best available (highest) bid price when selling securities, as governed by Regulation NMS."

These are typically in groups of 100, like we all know, and can have a spread depending on how fast the data gets there and back again, by Bilbo Baggins (latency, son). I don't really want to get into how this is all working, because latency plays a factor and is described on the website, and because people with more knowledge than me can explain it better. What I did want it to lead to was this; this data is OWNED by one group. Another company listed on the NYSE, in which the DMM is, yeah, that one.

Fucking ICE, again.

Is it just me that it seems weird to that the Intercontinental Exchange, is listed on the NYSE, has had steady growth with, like, no fucking bad times, and has this intimate relationship with a DMM that can pretty much do whatever they want? All while SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTROLLING THE FUCKING DATA TAPES??? They literally accept the data, consolidate the data, disseminate the data, and trade their own symbol, through themselves??? Are you fucking kidding me? In what realm is this not a monopoly on data or a conflict of interest? I have said from the beginning this is a data whore competition. And those in control don't want to lose that, they want to keep the cash cow producing, and they want retail to keep throwing their money in the pot so they can see where it is going (hint odd lots, PFOF, robinhood, blah blah blah).

or, rick and his banana

Here is where it gets a bit fun. Who are the entities involved in commenting on these rules? You know, the odd lot ones that they have wanted to contribute to data tapes for 2 years that are still being worked out.

[![r/Superstonk - It's Just a Pyramid Scheme Part 2: The Top of the Pyramid](https://preview.redd.it/5w2bere87r171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca38bae34ce7cf4ac78c0e8a5d4336f38b963bd)](https://preview.redd.it/5w2bere87r171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca38bae34ce7cf4ac78c0e8a5d4336f38b963bd)

This pretty much says they want to include what retail is paying and disseminate it on the data feeds, which would give a pretty decent glimpse into (as per the SEC MIDAS) the growth of odd lots from "5.7% of volume and 21% of trades in 2013 to almost 11% of volume and 38% of trades in 2018". Holy fuck. Almost 40% is retail blocks? Well who benefits from this? Retail, obviously, it'll drive the price up when HFTs aren't as effective because retards just hit "Market Buy" (you're fucking right I do). And as per our buddy Jim, "price doesn't matter to these guys they just keep buying". Haha fuck ya we do. Anyway, here is who commented:

Astonishingly enough, most of them are positive. Long term investors might not benefit as much as, say, giant hedge funds who trade extremely fast? And skimming bit-by-bit equals A LOT.

The anonymous ones are funny -- "HELL NO". Obviously someone is making some money off of NBBOs and Odd Lots. Shitadel, however, 100% for. Weird. Butttt, our theories have come to conclude that Kenni Boi wants to know what retail is doing because we are dumb money, and he likes to bet against us. This is why his risk management strat is so important here. As history states, average hodl time has gone from 7 years to 100 days (I cant remember that reference, it's here somewhere). This is why the banks invested so heavily in hedgefucks and derivatives. In my last DD, I showed you an organization called the Options Clearing Corp, that seems to be helping them cook their numbers. I noticed last Friday, that as soon as I posted their OIV website about the IV not matching Yahoo and Barchart, they closed the bypass. Lol. If that doesn't help your confirmation bias about who is watching us, I don't know what will. Because as I stated, they seem to be changing the greeks in order to manipulate the books. For the banks. And I have found some even more fun information with regard to how these entities are overseen (if you want to call it that). So why is this company overrun with banking fatcats and executives? Because it is the banking brokerage arms that are fucked here. Not just the hedgefucks. And they legit think they are too big to fail. Fucking Dimon and that dumbass smug look on his face. Just mocking us because they think we don't know what we know. I'm going to build the A.P.E. Exchange and not let you play in it! Too immature? Ok moving on.

Why do all these people leave big banks and regulators to go work for hedge fucks and small firms? Because its easier to skim a few hundred million from the public in a smaller firm than it is a massive banks with huge government oversight.

Global Systemically Important Banks. Funny because it almost implies they have a carte-blanche to do what ever the fuck they want as long as the appearance is that they are benefiting the public, not loaning in a fractional reserve system to hedgefucks who then just take the money back in and inflate (grossly) the amount on the books. Oh wait... You mean, they only receive what is called "Supervisory Guidance"? What the fuck is that?

Interesting... So, like, all these rules we are seeing passed, guarantee that we as retarded apes will be protected, right?

[![r/Superstonk - It's Just a Pyramid Scheme Part 2: The Top of the Pyramid](https://preview.redd.it/03falqs08r171.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b060fe66183815e0ad7ce2fe36d029612a434d0)](https://preview.redd.it/03falqs08r171.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b060fe66183815e0ad7ce2fe36d029612a434d0)

Yeahhhh. Of course we are the ones protected. Not the¬†Self. Regulated. Organization.¬†These should be conducted in private so the public doesn't get pissed off when they see how sheeple they really are. So, want to see who really has interest in these the data and numbers staying hidden? Here's a little excerpt from the¬†Chamber of Commerce¬†site about the House Finance Committee Meeting, and for some unknown reason, a regulation we were all hoping would be passed.

[![r/Superstonk - It's Just a Pyramid Scheme Part 2: The Top of the Pyramid](https://preview.redd.it/rb58auo88r171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=22a680bbbe3ad20287cc23483ac0ef4fbf779516)](https://preview.redd.it/rb58auo88r171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=22a680bbbe3ad20287cc23483ac0ef4fbf779516)

That's odd. Why would the Chamber of Commerce be opposed to the committees recommendation?

Oh I know, is it because private businesses classified as "small/medium sized enterprises" that might be laundering money off-shore for the mega rich would be exposed to small time investors that could actually get liquidated and pay out 10's of millions of dollars? No never mind that doesn't seem likely.

I'm at a loss. Because we have this retarded system that would put more money back into the economy if by some crazy chance short interest through banks and hedgefucks had to be covered. And for some reason, the main enterprise representing small businesses, and even provide them with Metlife mutual funds and insurance, doesn't want public small investors to know where the money is. In fact, they¬†*explicitly*¬†state "Global tax authorities already have access to..." Soooo, why has the Fed, SEC, IMF, fuck sakes even the local neighborhood watch at this point, not looked into where the money is flowing? Well they probably have, and don't want to tell us. And why the money printer has to constantly go brrrr for companies that have subsidiaries based in Brazil, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands, etc. Seriously, type a major bank into your search engine with the word subsidiaries next to it. Youll see what I mean (<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000119312508043536/dex211.htm>). They know money is flowing out of the country to these master funds, holding companies, etc. And only a handful really are listed through their 13Fs? There's another interesting term I only came across when I started looking at Citadels filings. "Event Driven Master Fund".

Either $27T is just what is on the books in the US, and the greenback is literally sitting in foreign bank accounts to promote the status quo -- or money is being funneled out of the country faster than the shorts master funds are draining at this point, to allow the 1% (whoever that may be), to do whatever they want with as long as it can be transferred to their own holding company. I too, want to know what's in those funds. I think the public is owed that much considering it's the almighty tax dollar that keeps being printed. No? The global economy is literally at risk because money printer go brrrr.

Something I really only grasped yesterday, the fact that Reddit most likely had a sueball thrown at it after or before the Jan gamma ramp. Crymer pretty much confirmed that in his CNBC interview when he said we should be classified as a buying group. Basically, we are either protected by freedom to speak our minds on here and speculate. Or we are an entity that wants to invest. A guy shoved a banana up his ass on here the other day. I haven't heard of many wall street investment funds that have people doing that (could just be because they don't want people to know, but whatever, we are just a group of retarded apes). One of two things are happening behind the scenes I believe:

1.  The global elite who have used the banks, hedge funds and US economy as their own personal slush funds for 50+ years are failing to contain short interest to obliterate companies and take back pensions they didn't want to give out in the first place. And they will drag this out as long as they can before they try to blame retail. Or;

2.  BlackRock and Vanguard are actually the 1% taking control over a new generation that has continued to question why we are actually slaving away. I can only speculate with this, as they literally have majority ownership of a TON of fucking companies. Even the banks. ICE, GME, everything.

Personally, I think it's number 1 now. BlackRock and Vanguard seem to have kind of played the role of balancing the force, and will take over when these guys start to default. Which is why A LOT of funds are holding BLK or iShares. But I am not sure. Ill leave that to you guys to decide. Either we are all fucked no matter what, or this is going to $20M and shit will change for the better. The only thing Ill say is; You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain. Going to take a little break from digging for a little bit. The only thing really left is panama papers to cross reference with everyone on these executive boards. We can probably trace some offshore accounts to those people. But again, I don't want to get into that. It isn't the time.

But what I will say is this, I think A.P.E. Exchange as an open source, free, non-profit exchange would be a good idea. Could probably be coded in a year. Because for one, people we trust are telling us there are just bugs popping up. Go look at the technical docs on the CTA site and tell me they aren't fiercely regulated against coding issues and hacks. The other possibility exists that we could move to GMEs new blockchain, a nice place we are watching be born, with no manipulation. But who knows.

Anyway, I'll leave it at that. You guys are big boys now too, we can all make decisions on how we should proceed. If we are going to wait for FINRA to do the right thing and potentially stop their data fallacies. Or if ICE needs to be removed from the equation because they have too many hands in all the facets of the data networks. Or if these SROs should maybe have more oversight than just the SEC holding my giant rocket dick, edging me while we haven't even crested $10k yet.

Personally, I just like the stock, and buying, hodling and voting makes me extremely erect.

To Ape, Didn't Read the TLDR:¬†GME to $20M or bust, fuck your pennies otherwise.

See you guys in the comments. Tomorrow probably.

Oh ya and
