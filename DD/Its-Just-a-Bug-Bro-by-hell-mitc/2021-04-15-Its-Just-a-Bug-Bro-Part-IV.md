TL;DR: You need to know who actually owns what, and why the S&P is inverse of GME. Vanguard and Blackrock...

Alright everyone. It just got a lot fucking weirder for me. And I honestly hope someone can poke a hole in how this all works. Because if not, it means we are, in fact, invested in an entire system that wasn't meant for us to figure out. I think I was right in my last comment when I said Citadel was the lamb to be slaughtered. And whoever is pulling the strings is watching us all fucking dance around, literally like apes.

I came across the fact that Blackrock and Vanguard own literally the ENTIRE S&P500 majority. Don't believe me? Check it out. Between them, they are the largest percentage of ownership of almost¬†every single company¬†on the S&P... I am not sure what to do with this info, or really what it means. According to holding reports, Vanguard actually owns Blackrock. They are apparently partners in the entire market.

Now, if you know anything about company voting, majority has the rule. So 14% will almost trump the entire list of companies holding additional shares if they can't agree on the situation (throw 20 people in a room who have different interests that 100% agree and I will literally tattoo that crazy¬†[r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/)¬†logo on my body - when we all figure this out and take a trip to the moon, I will anyway).

This, in and of itself means that one company has controlling stake of the (again, I will reiterate)¬†THE ENTIRE S&P500.¬†So, I am personally curious how this relates to GME. The only thing I can figure, is this:

For GME, there are definitely enough companies with interest to overrule Blackrock and Vanguard. Now, I am not saying they are against GME, but I am definitely saying that the interest is different depending on who is your friend on this list. And how many shares are held by retail. So why would the stock we all like, be moving at a¬†NEGATIVE UNICORN FUCKING 30+ BETA???

I am not trying to spread FUD or anything, I am looking for answers, and I expect of all my DDs, this one is the most controversial. Because something is wrong.

Larry Fink said today: "...We never had any convos with our clients surrounding crypto, and we never had any convos regarding reddit and gamestop...but it is fun to watch..."

WHAT THE FUCK?

CNBC - the group that has been against all of us from the start. Interviewing who we have thought was on our side, stating this is¬†*FUN???*¬†Okay....

SO... I am starting to think that we may be looking in the wrong direction. Not that the shorts aren't to blame in this, but I think we are missing something. And I am not sure where to look from here. The knowledge is absolutely mind boggling.

Because I have been saying I think it is the banks. But all the banks that we have been accusing along the way, they are¬†OWNED IN A MAJORITY SENSE BY BLACKROCK AND VANGUARD.

Now, Vanguard I cant get much info on.

"At Vanguard you're more than just an investor, you're an owner."

What the fuck do you own? The entire market? Because that would seem to be the case at¬†[vanguard.com](https://vanguard.com/). And if that is the case, then Vanguard is the safest bet for "Stonks only go up".

"Invest in us for your 2% per year forever, guaranteed!!!" What a better way to keep retail from hooking into 20% annual gains by throwing a dart at a phone book?

I am not sure what else to look for. We can't simply blame Citadel for creating this, because $7T>$400B (by about oh I don't know, 15x). So, I really need some help here, this isn't DD. This is research. This is something that could change how 150K people view what is going on. And I don't want to be the cause of this for spreading misinformation. I want help. But this is fucked.¬†*I NEED HELP.*

Something about this not being financial advise, but honestly if you want gains, apparently just invest in BLK or a Vanguard fund. Holy fuck.

EDIT: BlackRock Algorithm!!!

I found some patents related to rating cybersecurity and stocks related to "Blackrock Algorithm" but I need a couple more days to read them. They are 10x more complex than Kenny Gs....
