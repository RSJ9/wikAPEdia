-All the call options made yesterday during and after the attack were made from the Philadelphia Exchange - the same exchange that many bets were placed last week

-A huge number of those call options were sold today ~ 50-60%

-It is not a guarantee that call options were made by longs

-A huge number of call options were purchased RIGHT at the dip/tanking of the stock yesterday our current theory is this was done by longs... but isn't that a bit too convenient? Wouldn't it make more sense it was timed/bought by the person that created the dip?

-There was 150k open call options mid-day Wednesday between 300-800 which is where I'm getting the 15 mil number from CAN SOMEONE GET ME THE EXACT SHORT DATA FOR WEDNESDAY???

The enemy shorts clearly have plenty of capital/liquidity, what they lack is real shares of GME and the risk of having their shorts/interest hugely underwater due to high price points. I think that the shorts have realized the squeeze is imminent for a while now - the tide is against them and one really smart play would be to buy TONS of ITM/OTM calls for the days/weeks you expect the squeeze to occur - why? Because imagine how much you could short with 10-25 million shares handed to you in a day. The idea is simple - let GME explode to 800, collect your 10-25 million shares and instead of covering or getting margin called you literally nuke the fuck out of the price and bring it back down to under 100 buying yourself more time, creating paper hands, stop loss, margin calls, and now a hugely negative sentiment towards the stock. I think that last Friday our long whales smelled out a bull trap @ 150. There were a huge number of call options placed from PHI exchange for 150-200. I think that our long whales were unaware if those were friendly or enemy calls so they touched the price point (150.5 exactly) to see if they would activate the calls or hold on to them. (Ideally a short hedge fund could activate calls after hours and control the price easier with less fomo/buying power). When they touched the price and realized the calls were not being activated during normal trading hours they immediately retreated to actually UNDER 140. Why? They were clearly concerned about ITM calls and thought it was a high likelihood these were enemy short calls.

Now this brings us to this weeks battle - obviously the runup on mon-tue was legendary and we were immediately pushing 250 by midday Tuesday - but the SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED. We touched 250.5 during normal trading hours and NO CALLS ACTIVATED - immediately there was pullback that prevented it touching 250 for the rest of the trading day. I think that Citadel (who is main headquartered in Chicago like a block away from the Options Market) bought tons of calls last week and this week @ the PHI exchange to throw off our huge bull run and try to get a huge number of shares handed to them by call makers so they can establish a new roof. Imagine being able to short 10 million shares from 400 down. Or 15 million shares from 900 down. It only took them 7 million shares to get us from 480-70. I think our whales are actually holding the price back so that the shorts cant get a bunch of free call shares that they sneakily placed from a different exchange trying to make it look like a friendly to the longs. If I'm correct in this theory, tomorrow we will see the same little to no price movement to prevent the short calls from activating.

Also this would make sense of why we saw so many calls bought after the huge attack yesterday and also why the recovery was so easy. Imagine you are planning on buying 100k calls that day... it would make a ton of sense to sell 3 million shares to get a much better price point and then buy it right back to the existing price and getting back 2.5-2.7 million of the shares you sold at similar prices you sold at. I actually think our longs were selling yesterday and holding back the shorts from activating the calls they placed during their dip attack. Imagine if the battle yesterday with those crazy graphs was actually the shorts buying the price up and our longs selling it back down to prevent the calls from going ITM. Fucking epic because that would mean the shorts lost and realized they wouldn't be able to activate their calls so therefore sold them today to recoup some money but still leave an existing threat from 300-800.

Also this fucks apes that bought call options for friday thinking the MOASS was imminent. It also uses our own buying power against our long whales.

Something of note- the first gamma squeeze occured AFTER HOURS on a FRIDAY from 100-180... Maybe this was actually the shorts collecting a bunch of shares after hours but quickly manipulating the price back down to sub 100. This could of been what triggered the epic battle from 70-150 because the shorts had new ammo and our whales learned what they were doing and were smarter and more methodical as they approached 150/250/300/350

BTW this explains DFV's cat GIF today where the cat is peeking out cautiously before jumping out of the box.... it's a metaphor for us or our long whales not jumping into a bad situation and cautiously approaching new price points

Also I just wanted to say fuck everyone in this thread calling me a FUD shill or for a lack of back end options/margin knowledge just because I've never been broke or stupid enough to trade/gamble with borrowed money (where im from people die wtf is a margin call?) or make dumbass yolo broke boy options bets into 100 billion dollar hedge fund price manipulator algos YOU ARE THE FUCKING IDIOTS. I was posting pro-gme shit AT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM. I was one of the original posters in this subreddit and I have bought gme at almost EVERY PRICE POINT AVAILABLE (350/320/250/193/120/70/55/45) I have more diamonds in my hands, dick, testicles, and wrists than everyone you know combined and I would be your wifes boyfriend but she ugly as shit and got no ass so its a no from me dawg so stop fucking asking and go get my #1 meal no lettuce no mayo single with a diet coke 6 spicy nuggets no sauce and a small chocolate frosty I KNOW THIS IS A WENDYS SO STOP HARASSING ME AND GET MY FUCKING FOOD IM A 7 FIGURE N1GGA AND YOU A DUMB BITCH TYPING STUPID HATEFUL SHIT ON THE INTERNET

WE WILL SEE TOMORROW WHO IS RIGHT THIS IS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO [/u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/) AND [/u/HeyItsPixel](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixel/) honestly I love you guys but I don't agree with your analysis or DD very often (It's ok fam we all love the stock and you guys are great mods and funny as fuck)- But I find your game theory and DD simple minded, dumbed down, and not dynamic enough with the factors/variables involved. I bet we close under 300 in the 250-280 range just to inflict maximum damage to the calls and start a huge run Monday after the call path is cleared.
