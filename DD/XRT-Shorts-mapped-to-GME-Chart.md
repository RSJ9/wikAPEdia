After hearing about the potential link to XRT being used as a proxy for shorting GME, I thought I'd see if iBorrowDesk had records on XRT, and [it sure as fuck does!](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT)

So I took a look through at each decline in shares available to be shorted and mapped them up on the GME chart and the connection is undeniable. XRT is 100% where shorts are shorting in order to hide their movements from us.

I suspect iBorrowDesk isn't getting data in realtime for XRT, so a lot of the shares don't get reflected until the EOB, which is why the data of the parabolic upswing, we have 1 Million shares being shorted reported at the EOD, when it really most likely happened at the top of that upswing.

XRT is now the site of the GME proxy war.

*edit:* because all of the shorting on GME had dried up, I thought all the downward price movements were actually from us. I thought we were paper-handing, guys. But it wasn't us. It's still the hedge funds. I'm sorry that I ever doubted you. We all truly do have fucking diamond hands.

*edit 2:* Original post linking XRT to GME: <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious_researchers_needed_now_i_think_i_know/>

*edit 3:* Holy fuck! According to [this site](https://www.etfchannel.com/type/most-shorted-etfs/) XRT is currently 180% short! Thanks to [/u/SnooWoofers9008](https://www.reddit.com/u/SnooWoofers9008/) for pointing that out!

~~*edit 4:*~~~~ According to ~~[~~https://www.etf.com/stock/AMC~~](https://www.etf.com/stock/AMC)~~, XRT also holds 6.5 million shares in AMC. This could be a missing link that explains how AMC and GME price charts became linked in the last few weeks! Thanks to ~~[/u/IsleepWithOpenAyes](https://www.reddit.com/u/IsleepWithOpenAyes/)~~ for pointing this out!~~ removed because I cannot find the portion of the site that corroborates this statement.

*edit 5:* Lots of people are asking what this means for the play, do you buy XRT or GME etc. I have a few half answers to offer. The first is I don't know your situation, only you know your position and how best to handle it, and I'm not qualified to provide financial advice. Also, I personally will not be going long on XRT. If the squeeze squozes, I think the effect will be more impactful to positions in GME since HFs will have to liquidate their other positions they've been buying in other stocks in the EFT. I personally will continue averaging down and holding GME, and watching <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT> for further confirmation bias about when shorts are attacking the stocks I like.
