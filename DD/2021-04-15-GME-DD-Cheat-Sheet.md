[DD üë®‚Äçüî¨](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

[The MOASS is Inevitable](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mjo3jj/the_moass_is_inevitable/). It's no longer a question of if, just when.

Here is a cheat sheet to get you through the FUD when this takes off. The most important thing to remember here is that Apes have the data to back the thesis.

It will be a bumpy ride, but the DD here will make it easier:

Look back over things they've done to scare you into selling...

-   [FUD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnjqpw/dont_forget_what_they_did_a_running_list_of_fud/)

-   [Market Manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mqyp5w/now_is_the_time_to_stay_ready_a_running_list_of/)

And yet Apes¬†[still](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcw74g/even_yesterday_there_was_a_31_buysell_ratio_on/)¬†[have](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mebvks/daily_fidelity_update_buysell_ratio_still/)¬†[diamond](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mo0qp2/buysell_ratio_is_51_on_fidelity_apes_buying_the/)¬†[hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpw0ru/fidelity_orders_updated_412_still_looking_like_a/)

You wouldn't short a car would you? Well Citadel would, probably.

Citadel has shorted everything to oblivion and the bill is about to come due. Press X to hold.

-   [The Everything Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)

-   More¬†[Naked Shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/)

It's easy to sit there and think the numbers being thrown around aren't realistic, and that's because up until now they haven't been.

-   [KBIO Squeeze was 6% SI with 10,000% growth](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/)

-   [Overstock was 13.7% SI with 4000% growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mqt7w6/gamestop_vs_overstock/)

-   [VW was 12-15% SI with 500% growth](https://imgur.com/a/Z2bF2wy)

    -   The part that always gets me, "Why did the short sellers hang on for so long when the tide was moving against them? Perhaps they remained focused on the long-term anticipated drop in price rather than the risk of being squeezed in the meantime." What'd we learn Kenny?

Yes, these are entirely different scenarios, and each one had additional variables that affected the squeeze. But it really puts things in perspective huh?

Because:

GME Short Interest*

-   [Conservative Short Interest Calculation: 38M](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzj00a/super_conservative_calculation_puts_gme_short/)¬†(~147%)

-   [Slightly less conservative: 250-900%](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m19oh7/true_short_interest_could_be_anywhere_from_250_to/)

GME Float

-   [APES. OWN. THE. FLOAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

-   [Float/SI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mofkra/institutional_ownership_and_short_interest_proof/)

*DD to get a realistic understanding of Short Interest:

-   [Fake Shares to Millionaires Common Misconceptions of Short Interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mmo9kw/from_fake_shares_to_millionaires_common/)

-   [Mythbusters DD: Can We Set Share Price](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhjfee/mythbuster_dd_can_you_set_the_price_for_your/)

[January was a 1500% increase](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-mania-explained-how-the-reddit-retail-trading-crowd-ran-over-wall-street-pros.html)¬†and that wasn't even the squeeze.

The only thing that truly matters, is that by most conservative estimates, Short Interest is over 100%, and Apes own a significant portion of the float.

If even after all of this you STILL find yourself doubting, take a look back at the long term value. Or should I say,¬†[the Deep Fucking Value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U)

And there you have it. The only doubts you should have left over should be about what champagne you're celebrating with.

As for your¬†[exit strategy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/)

From /u/BinBender's Fake Shares to Millionaires

[Look at what this community created.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj1wqv/a_comprehensive_compilation_of_all_due_diligence/)¬†Look at the time and effort that's been put in. The DD is incredible. Take a moment to appreciate what "dumb money" has accomplished. Thank you to every Ape here for being a part of this, from¬†[r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/), to¬†[r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), to¬†[r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/), to every other sub. You all are truly amazing.

The hard DD has been done. The only thing that can work against the squeeze now is the artificial limit you place on it.

[Remember why you hold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKNU04cMvU)

[Remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqmhnm/its_430_am_cant_sleep_read_the_dd_a_million_times/)¬†[why](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mqukfw/i_hodl_to_afford_my_transgender_surgery/)¬†[the](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m83920/this_is_why_i_hold_its_time_for_things_to_change/)¬†[Ape](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr4ec7/live_in_my_vehicle_this_is_my_bed_and_that_drink/)¬†[next](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo9bjt/this_is_why_im_holding/)¬†[to](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lur26s/why_they_hold/)¬†[you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/moqsuv/why_i_will_hold_to_the_end_whatever_that_looks/)¬†[holds](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1dj8/why_im_holding_gme/)

And that's really all that's left to do: Hold for yourself, and hold for the Ape next to you. That's the only way GME hits 10M. It's that simple.
