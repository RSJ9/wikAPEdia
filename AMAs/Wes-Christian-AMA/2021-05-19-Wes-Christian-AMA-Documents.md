Thanks again for taking the time to listen to the AMA yesterday, I've received so much positive feedback. It's great to hear that this has been helpful. Wes mentioned some documents that he provided me, which I've shared via Google Drive - anyone should be able to access and download them: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16UlzyBjBp98GrGEOU0SJTgI8HPpr4LFf?usp=sharing>

If there are follow-up questions, I can try my best to get responses, although it can be tough to wade through everything. If one of the mods wants to help with this, it would be very appreciated!
