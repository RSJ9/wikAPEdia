[If you have not seen it yet I (nor the group I have been putting together) will not be able to continue making the Daily Stonk here is the extra Daily Stonk post that I talk about it a bit more.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovpyof/the_daily_stonk_08012021_the_last_daily_stonk_if/)

This is a post detailing the general process of how to run the Daily Stonk/news as a group on discord that I made for the group I was putting together and it's mostly a copy-paste.

Note in discord we had 8 text channels

1.  how to create the daily stonk and info (locked channel containing everything from step 1 and below)

2.  important posts that needs synopsis (channel topic "To claim a post add your personal reaction, the first reaction claims the post, once a synopsis have been added post it in "important posts with synopsis to be added to the daily stonk" ")

3.  posts that needs synopsis (channel topic "To claim a post add your personal reaction, the first reaction claims the post, once a synopsis have been added post it in "posts with synopsis to be added to the daily stonk" ")

4.  posts unsure if they should be added (channel topic "If a post should be used claim it and add your personal reaction, the first reaction claims the post, once a synopsis have been added post it in "posts with synopsis to be added to the daily stonk" ")

5.  discarded posts (posts that weren't good enough to be add to the Daily Stonk)

6.  important posts with synopsis to be added to the daily stonk (channel topic "If a post has been added to the daily stonk add your personal reaction to it")

7.  posts with synopsis to be added to the daily stonk (channel topic "If a post has been added to the daily stonk add your personal reaction to it")

8.  general (for organizing and talking with the members)

How to create the Daily Stonk.

There are 3 main roles curators, writers and editor.

Step 1. The curators look at and curate posts on SuperStonk, if the post contains relevant important information, relevant interesting information, relevant important news, relevant news, relevant important discussion, relevant interesting discussion that is daily worthy they will add the post to "important-posts-that-needs-synopsis", "posts-that-needs-synopsis" or "posts-unsure-if-they-should-be-added" as is fitting. The curators can also add in memes if they are highly upvoted and/or highly relevant as long as it does not clutter the daily stonk but they are less priority as information and news comes first.

There is no general upvote requirement to add posts but the majority of posts that are added usually have 700-2000 or more upvotes. When curating Superstonk you should be on the sorting rank Hot, In Hot there are generally 3 stages to scrolling, Stage 1 Furthest up are the most active and upvoted posts generally 2000+ upvotes, Stage 2 Middle contains the most posts generally 700-2000 upvotes, Stage 3 Lower (under 100 posts I believe) usually contain newer posts with 300-500 upvotes, you do not have to look too hard at those posts as the majority of them will not be added and the ones that do usually rise to stage 1-2 so take a break and look at stage 1-2 again in a few hours, ideally once every 3-4 hours, this is to make sure that the posts don't come in all at once at the end of the day but rather over the day so that the writers can take their time when they have time and don't have to stress and to make sure you don't miss any posts. If you're unsure which posts are Daily worthy look at previous Daily Stonk posts or ask someone for help. If there are multiple curators then before you add a post check if it has already been added.

Step 2. The writers will look at "important-posts-that-needs-synopsis", "posts-that-needs-synopsis" and "posts-unsure-if-they-should-be-added" for new posts, they will then claim an unclaimed post by adding their reaction to the post, just in case 2 or more try and claim the same post the first name will handle the post they will then read through the post and once they understand the post or at least the general premise they will then write a short but informative synopsis detailing, to the best of their abilities the premise and main point of the post, the writing style is mostly left to the writers discretion but try to keep in mind the above and to be kind and classy and if the post's title isn't very descriptive the writers will make a short descriptive one themself.

The writers will also look at the comments and see if there are any good points or arguments relevant to the post, if there are they will make a synopsis of that comment and add it under the post's synopsis with the link to the comment above the comment synopsis and credit the user of the comment.

If a writer claims a post but does not believe it should be added to the daily stonk they will post it in "discarded posts" if someone else believes it should be added then they will claim the post and write it themself following step 2.

If you're having difficulties understanding a post and difficulties writing the synopsis try to describe the post and poster's intent instead, for example "vice1337 made a post explaining how the daily stonk is made" or if all else fails you can just say you do not know how to make a Synopsis for the post and tell them to go read it, after all, you can't explain or make a synopsis for everything.

A hyperlink headline text should be the title text. Once the piece has been finished you will then post it in "posts with synopsis to be added to the daily stonk"

The layout of a piece is:

"Headline or hyperlink to post" - u/"user" (remove "- u/"user" " if headline)

"hyperlink to post if a headline is created" - u/"user"

Synopsis

"Synopsis of a comment if there is one" - comment by u/"user" (the Synopsis of the comment will be hyperlinked to the comment) (Synopsis and comment Synopsis can be swapped if it's fitting)

(repeat if more comments)

Example 1

New GameStop Newsletter (headline)

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osazeu/gamestops_official_twitter_account_shared_this/> - [u/Ashage](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ashage/) (hyperlink)

<https://newsletter.gamestop.com/> (direct link that the topic is talking about, added for ease of finding)

GameStop has a new newsletter but there is a bit of a disagreement in the comments on whether this is a customer newsletter or an investor newsletter as all the menu items are for investor relations rather than customer stuff. (synopsis)

Example 2

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oq7m5c/janet_yellen_warns_of_potential_default_and_the/> - [u/NirpUmbrella](https://www.reddit.com/u/NirpUmbrella/) (hyperlink headline)

Here is the link <https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/yellen-urges-congress-to-raise-debt-limit-by-aug-2-or-treasury-will-take-extraordinary-measures-to-prevent-default.html>

The comments are quite sure that the government will raise the debt limit. (synopsis)

Step 3. The editor will then take posts in "posts with synopsis to be added to the daily stonk" add a reaction to the post and add it in a draft on Reddit and format it. The editor will be responsible for making the post title and remembering to change the date to the day it will be posted, for adding a comment to each text channel with the next Daily Stonk post date after they post a Daily stonk to make the timeline easier to follow, for adding in the copypasta, for making an "Intro sentence", adding in posts and formating everything as in the example below, to update and edit the post and grammar and to change the bold text under EXCELLENT! to whatever feels the most relevant and add in anything new if there is a need. Make sure to look at a previous Daily to properly format the post.

Format example:

The Daily Stonk 07-27-2021 (title)

"The Daily Stonk image"

Good Morning SuperStonk,

Today was a busy day sorry if it's a bit hastily put together (Intro sentence)

"stonks image"

The comments are quite sure that the government will raise the debt limit. (synopsis)

Yesterday we asked for your input if the Daily Stonk should continue as a group effort and the comments were positive for it to continue as a group effort (Ending comments if there is anything the editor or group wants to say, correct, inform, etc)

"Bill and Ted's be excellent to each other image"

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

4\. Extra info

Everyone is responsible for curating the content that is under their responsibility so anyone can remove/discard/not add posts if they feel they are not Daily worthy while it's in their hands, which means the posts are essentially "curated" 3 times to ensure quality and ideally no one should take offence if someone else removes/discard a post while it's not in their hands as we don't want disagreements or drama.

And keep in mind that it's fine if we miss or discard a good post as it's still on SuperStonk and there is no rush, take your time.

Posts are added progressively as they are completed to the next SuperStonk even if the post was for yesterday this way we don't have to stress to make or add posts in the evening and morning and just add them as they are done.

Everyone is welcome to claim a post and write a synopsis if you feel like it but there is no pressure if that's not your role.

Ideally, there Should be 2 Curators one who takes one half of the day and the other the second half,

there should be 2-3 writers ideally they should not have to spend more than 1 hour per normal day

and 1 Editor.

SuperStonk curating schedule

If we curate the subreddit about every 3 hours then we need to check it about 8 times per day. We will use UTC for time zones. Ideally, it would be good if you claim 2 or more consecutive times as it would reduce the need to crosscheck what has been added already. There is no need to check it exactly at the claimed time but within some hour of it would be good if you can.

This schedule will only be a general timetable and doesn't necessarily have to be followed to the letter, it's just mostly there to make sure someone is checking around that time so we don't miss posts and can get posts in gradually so we can pick them off in smaller batches.

Please choose the times you think you can check on a regular basis, that said if you can't check at the time sometimes that's fine as it will probably be seen and found by someone else, and while we have a schedule you can curate any other time you want as well.

00:00 - unclaimed 03:00 - unclaimed 06:00 - unclaimed 09:00 - unclaimed 12:00 - unclaimed 15:00 - unclaimed 18:00 - unclaimed 21:00 - unclaimed
