ThisÂ [repository](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia)Â of GME-related content and relevant information serves two primary purposes:

1.  Organize useful information so that it can be easily referenced in the future.

2.  Create an archive of relevant posts in case Reddit goes down or information is deleted from the internet.

3.  A place to share GME data for all DD researchers to access (wikAPEdia/Data/Data-Dumps)

The userÂ [u/Meticulous-](https://www.reddit.com/u/Meticulous-/)Â has stressed that this project would not have been created without the GME communities passion and contributors deserve all the credit.
