3/25 Micro (5-minute) - i of 5 of (i) of III almost complete

*"There's no need to be scared now; It's all the fun of a Fairground' ~* *The Stupendium**

Yeah, those down days. They can be scary. (Well not for us Diamond Hands, but I digress). But oh what an up day can do for morale.

TL;DR - Primary Count: Corrective waves appear to be complete at the major degree waves (like (4) and/or II). Impulse moves to the upside on high volume appear to have taken the wheel. Minor pullbacks (of 1/3 to 1/2 the last completed five-wave move) expected as we move higher.

In Ape - Got low enough on last branch to jump onto bigger branch that leads higher. Will be swinging up then slightly down to grab next higher branch. Loads of Bananas are now visible up higher, and can almost see even more above that. These branches are looking pretty sturdy, and lots less worried about falling than I was yesterday (or for the last week even).

Discussion -

A 50%+ up day, on great volume in each wave up. Who's Jacked!?!?! Classic impulse move to shake off the corrective action and (hopefully) continue in 5-wave moves of increasingly larger degrees.

Hmmm - 3rd waves are usually unmistakable. This whole (4) and (5) I think we have been trying to resolve would need to be considered a Leading Diagonal in (III) which should target $500+. Watching that (4) continue lower and lower has me AGAIN wondering if the Alt Yellow count is still in play, where (II) was Alt (A), waves (1), (2), and (3) was actually an Alt (B) and (4) was actually (II) finally completing in the Yellow count. What that means is we are possibly looking at a Fresh 5-wave move to start (III), rather than it having already started in late February (see weekend update 60-minute chart).

Either way, it's great for us now... whether it was (II) or (4) completing, Elliott Wave Theory points us up, Up UP. Only a drop below this morning's low will have us questioning (4). All I can see is a Party Train Leaving the Station. If you are buying, I hope you snagged some. Wave ii should target a .5 retrace of i. (2nd waves are my favorite buying opportunities... they follow an impulse up, and precede a typically much larger impulse up from where they end.

You read that correctly, right? Elliott Wave acknowledges that markets and individual securities go up AND down. Show me a chart that never has, and I'll eat all my crayons. That would make me sad, and I have zero fear that you would prove it to force such a diabolical dietary dilemma.

The beauty of Elliott Wave is we KNOW there will be ups and downs, and we can very accurately project where the targets are for each up and down. Use that. As a sleeping pill if you must. I use it to make informed decisions about buying opportunities... Diamond Hand Polishing Agent at the least. This is not advice, financial, trading or otherwise. I'm an ape, remember?

A Tribe Called Quest -

*Fibs - Motive Waves:* Wave 3 absolutely NAILED the 1.618 extension (with 27 cents to spare). Yes... .618 and 1.618 are Golden! (see Phi/Golden ratio). Wave 3 typically targets the 1.382, so this is considered 'extended' by one fib. Projections for 5 then are raised to follow suit. It looks to me like wave 5 is trying to complete as an Ending Diagonal, and whereas a 5th would normally target the 1.764 extension, we must raise that target by a fib due to 3 extending by that much. Targeting the 2.000 extension is 185.35. We have already achieved that in this Ending Diagonal of 5. Wave 3 was extended. It is entirely possible 5 may extend too. The ensuing impulse to complete the 5th wave is in an overlapping three-wave structure (which you will NEVER see in a wave 3) so this must be 5. But busting out the channel lines (pink) helps me see that we may only have 3 of 5 in 5 in place. Those 3 have already struck the 2.000. The higher it goes, the bigger the pullback in ii. Be prepared for that. It is ok. It is expected (at least to us Elliotticians). All of this provides evidence that we really may be starting the big wave (III) now, instead of back in the first week of March. All three of our motive waves here have beautiful green Volume candles to go with them. Usually not what you see in corrective action. More evidence.

*Fibs - Corrective Waves:* Wave 2 retraced 1 to the .382 (that's .382 to .500 is fine) and only did it in 4 candles. Alternation tells us to expect 4 to look much different. It does. 4 looks funky. Corrective at the very least (which is why it is perfect for a 4). Wave 4 often only targets a mere .382 retrace of 3, and that's what we see here. It also took 13 candles to get there... Alternation from 2 as we'd expect. Wave 2 and 4 (and our other pullbacks today) all show very low volume. Also hallmark of a motive wave to the upside, and more evidence this truly is a new Impulse to the Upside.

This is fun, yeah? Lots more fun than the doldrums of watching a (4) or long C of (II) complete.

*"If there are secrets that you want to find out; Hop on the Ink Machine and Ride Those Pipes Down!" ~ The Stupendium**

Yes, you got a nice UP day. Be mentally prepared for wave ii. Target is .5 retrace of i (from where (4) completed to where i completes), so about 152 region. Once we get three down in ii, we can more accurately calculate what our targets will be for iii, iv and v/(1). Please keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times. We hope you enjoy your stay in Wave (III).

H4HU - Not a pro (that's your wife's bf), not advice (financial, trading, dietary or otherwise). I will benefit if GME goes up.... because I am hodling, and I like the stock.
