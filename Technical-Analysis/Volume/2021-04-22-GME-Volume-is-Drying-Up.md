Hey ape-stronauts!

Hope everyone is doing fine and dandy, we've become somewhat accustomed to low volume days with sideways trading now but I've began to notice something interesting in the charts in regards to volume and share sales and wanted to¬†*share*.

So strap yourselves in, stick on your space helmet and sit back.

TL;DR at the bottom but c'mon dude it's basically a picture book there ain't much to read.

There's a number of pictures below, I've set my charts to 1m intervals to get super fne detail on the trades taking place. Right now the graphs just look like circles and lines but let me explain. The circled bits are gaps in the trading (or blips as I call them cause it sounds more fun), what do I mean by that.

Well, when you want to buy GME at 150.50, for example you put in a buy order for that price but there's nobody selling it at that price, the next best thing you have is one share at 150.65. You have a choice to then either buy it at 150.65 or just wait and as humans we have the capabilities to make that sensible decision and wait for a better price but I believe the algorithms that run at these HFs don't. I'm probably over simplifying things but basically I'm saying the algos just buy at the next best available price which in this case would be 150.65. If the last sale of the previous candle finished at 150.45 and the first buy of the next candle started at 150.65 then that's where you get that discrepancy in the chart, that's where you get small "blip".

I mentioned earlier that humans are capable of making that decision to take the better price but sometimes your hand is forced like say for a broker, your client wants a share at this specific price but with there being no volume you have to take it at whatever is the next best price so you take the hit and get it for slightly more again causing that gap in the prices.

Someone feel free to tell me I'm wrong but this is my understanding of this whole thing, might have put on a small tinfoil hat for a bit about the algos thing but to me it makes sense with there being super low volume atm.

So what does this all mean? In the images below are the charts for the trading days beginning 13/04 till now. I had a quick look before this day at the charts and I didn't see any blatant gaps in the candles so I'm assuming 13/04 is when they started appearing.

Just take a look through the images below and I'll have my conclusion at the end of what I believe this all means.

13/4 - Holes starring Shia Labeouf begins

14/4 - No gaps in trading, looks like a normal GME trading day, makes sense also as this day we had over 20 million in volume

15/4 - Small blips start appearing where prices aren't met but for the most part a normal trading day

16/04 - Yep, that's quite a few more blips, starting to look a bit like a Freddy Krueger victim

19/04 - Blips, blips everywhere

[![r/Superstonk - GME, Charts and blips, lots of blips...](https://preview.redd.it/xaic5q7y8ru61.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=88898faa12b8e8b0366001ef57b5d8046db6087e)](https://preview.redd.it/xaic5q7y8ru61.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=88898faa12b8e8b0366001ef57b5d8046db6087e)

20/4 - Things are beginning to look a bit like Swiss cheese with all these holes in trading

[![r/Superstonk - GME, Charts and blips, lots of blips...](https://preview.redd.it/58hez7i79ru61.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=c330ce0a5bfc6e273ffe3a0a389085e61e636e2d)](https://preview.redd.it/58hez7i79ru61.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=c330ce0a5bfc6e273ffe3a0a389085e61e636e2d)

21/4 - Way more holes cropping up, more prices not being met

[![r/Superstonk - GME, Charts and blips, lots of blips...](https://preview.redd.it/sakyfu9g9ru61.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=d94082015ac9d35e35b8a97571651d2eb376dee2)](https://preview.redd.it/sakyfu9g9ru61.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=d94082015ac9d35e35b8a97571651d2eb376dee2)

22/4 - So far in trading day it's looking a bit like Spongebob, low volume, a lot of prices not being met and the day hasn't even finished yet

Conclusion

What I'm drawing from this is that volume is drying up (duh) but with that we're seeing prices being hit that usually wouldn't. I'd like to connect this with posts seen yesterday and today related to random price jumps in AH where it went from 150 to 250 and then back to 150 again like this one¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvptg8/can_someone_explain_this_price_jump_ah_on/>¬†and gaps being asked about here too¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvl64u/ta_question_ive_noticed_that_that_there_has_been/>¬†low volume starts to force people and algos to begin buying at prices higher than the current which means it won't be long before the swamp is all dried up and there's nothing to buy and brokers and HFs begin paying way higher prices for the shares.

But now you're wondering, well if that's the case then why hasn't the price been shooting up? I still believe there's enough low order shares being tossed around that the price isn't affected that much. It's also still probably being artifically set at this price by external parties but soon I believe we'll be on the path to the moon.

I'm going to keep an eye on these blips the rest of today and tomorrow but if we begin to see blips like these during normal trading session then boy is this stock about to lift off.

This is pre-market on 16/04

Feel free to tell me I'm talking complete bogus and there's nothing in this at all but until these gaps stop showing up I'm going to continue believing in this.

*TL;DR - Volume is drying up, it's like the Sahara desert out there, with low volume come blips in the candles where there's not enough sellers/buyers at a certain price forcing traders to buy shares at whatever the next best available price is. I believe this is setting us up for extreme volatility as asking prices for shares begin to get crazy.*

This has been my TED talk on blips, thank you for reading.
