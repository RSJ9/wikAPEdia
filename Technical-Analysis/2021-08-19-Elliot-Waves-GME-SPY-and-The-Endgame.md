Sup Apes.

Not financial advice, I am retarded.

fucking auto mod, i've spent the past 20 minutes re posting pictures and trying to beat the censors, but i have no idea what the issue is. decentralized currency starting with a B? does that satisfy you? smh.

It's currently late as shit, I'm currently on vacation with the fam as my birthday was 8/15 but I wanted to post an update for all you wave fiends.

To all the haters that say my TA isn't correct, SPY did exactly what I said it would 30 days ago, which has me jacked as FUCK because this lets us forecast more.

Don't lie to yourself and say you're here for the waves, I know you want that good crank. Look no further:¬†<https://open.spotify.com/track/6OufwUcCqo81guU2jAlDVP?si=4fda20dcc7a44574>

SPY 1 month ago

"If you looked at this and came to the conclusion that there is likely more upside, that is correct. This is because if you look at the minute count (white) you can see today was actually a wave 4. Looking deeper, the minuette count (purple, waves within the white wave 3) you can clearly see the 5 waves up, followed by the ABC down to complete the 4."

"If I'm right, I'd expect more green out of SPY from here, to put it bluntly, I see 444, 447, and 460 as final 5 of 5 of 5 of 5 targets. These are spread out as I haven't seen the new trend play out, as it starts to develop we can re evaluate, but these are BASE targets."

Everyone thought I was insane for saying I saw 440+ at the time, yet here we are. take that TA haters ;)

As i've said time and time again, EW requires much revisiting and tweaking as structures update every day. As trends develop we can assign more specific targets to specific wave movements, though in the beginning, we just have base targets.

If this is truly a new trend starting for SPY, we should not reclaim 441 and continue to move to the downside.

SPY pre market

okay whatever, what does this mean for GME?

My hypothesis has been that the market crash will be a catalyst that acts in our favor. As the market loses value, margin requirements increase, yada yada shorts need more collateral.

I also want to draw your attention to (decentralized currency starting w bee) quickly, as I believe this can also be used as a sort of precursor. I'm feeling mega üåà üêª but can you blame me?

currency starting w bee

This visual is a few days old as trading view deleted my drawing (annoying) and I'm too lazy to redraw, but this is the trajectory I expect from here on a base level. Could go very differently as can everything from here, but so far, this setup has made the most sense to me.

Basically, it LOOKS like cr___ (sorry lol i'm so annoyed w auto mod lol) and stonks have topped. Nothing is 100%, always stay vigilant and expect fuckery, but god fucking damn. What a time to *hodl GME*

here's SPY in relation to GME run's over the past few months:

decentralized currency that shall not be named for fucks sake

let's not forget my personal favorite, the VIX (volatility/fear indicator):

VIX

needless to say I'm fucking jacked to the max and I'm so happy I somehow found a way to cough up enough cash to increase my share count once again.

Onto GME, I'm fucking tired, but CANT STOP WONT STOP!

I could go more in depth with the intraday stuff but nobody cares. Also, this count was correct too, take that ta haters. Fibs gave me a wave 5 (purple) target of 170 (check recent post if you want proof, fibs are there and everything).

Remember 5 waves form 1 larger wave, thus the move to 170 was a wave 1. Wave 2 is a steep correction which I would argue we got.

[![r/GME - Elliott Waves, GME, SPY, The Endgame üöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/y5s15rypiai71.png?width=2806&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3232fa768b34d22b946978161f59c1f2eee3e1c)](https://preview.redd.it/y5s15rypiai71.png?width=2806&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3232fa768b34d22b946978161f59c1f2eee3e1c)

Wave 2 is a corrective wave, ie abc. most common we see a = c, or the 100% level in yellow. 1.618 is also a possibility, but again, intraday doesn't matter too much, the overarching setup is there. wave 2 most common retrace target is the .618 retrace (gold level) at 154.5, if anyone even cares. Idgaf cause if that's hit tmr I'll likely sleep through it.

The wave interpretation fits the narrative that we're do for a run soon. count with me. what comes after 2?

come on.

no, it's not 69, but good guess.

wave 3 in equities markets is most commonly the strongest and most powerful of the 5, but you've heard me say this so many times at this point you get the drill.

larger targets are unchanged as previous low of 145 has held. First major target I'm watching for is still 288.

Moonjam ends 8/20, monthlies expire, should be a wild ride.

Going back to SPY, I would like to point out the POSSIBILITY we see something called an expanding flat fractal. I'll try my best to visualize it with trading view:

[![r/GME - Elliott Waves, GME, SPY, The Endgame üöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/11wtne0riai71.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d4cb9a2eb4edbde7d378824c3724c1017c72ca)](https://preview.redd.it/11wtne0riai71.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d4cb9a2eb4edbde7d378824c3724c1017c72ca)

expanded flat fractal

in this case, for SPY we'd be looking for a bounce around¬†421.57.¬†if we bounce here to the upside, it is possible but not certain we see one final push to the upside before the rug is pulled.

Market geometry is a real thing, despite all the TA naysayers. TA is everywhere, the weather forecast is a perfect example. meteorologists don't just throw a dart at a board of numbers and say "it'll be x degrees today." no no, there are algorithms and trends and whatnot that are analyzed, which gives probabilities of certain outcomes. This is the exact same for trading and technical analysis.

When analyzing, you are looking to narrow down probabilities and bet on the outcome. when one fails, this narrows the possibilities. You picking up what I'm laying down?

anyway, I'm jacked to infinity.

As GME starts to move we can start to narrow down more upside targets, we don't know if we have completed a wave 2 as of yet as market isn't open (t minus 4 hours boys). let's just assume we bottomed yesterday at 156.75. This puts our first wave 3 target (1:1 of wave 1) at 181.38. this will be updated depending on if that really marked the low. if we drop another $2, the target is adjusted by $2, making it 179.38, if you want to watch it yourself and come up with targets.

Here are the targets visualized:

here's a cute ss from pre market showing just how dry liquidity is. All it takes is a little nudge of volume and it's off to the races.

a nice pre market spread for you

A quick aneurism for you. the .618 level at 288 in green is the first major level I'm watching for. Wave 1 within a wave 3 commonly hit this ratio when measuring the length of the wave 1 (this makes no sense if you don't trade waves I'm sorry, stay with me). Also note the gap down from earnings coincides with this target.

mothafuckinjacked.

Hope you enjoyed, my vacation is just me watching the GME ticker on the beach. That's the life.

Also, I'm extremely humbled to have made the front page of SS yesterday with this tweet, I fkn love all of you and the attitude everyone brings to the table. Apes together strong mother fuckers.

I'd say I'm going to sleep now but we all know that's a god damn lie.

TLDR: idek how to summarize, stock and (decentralized currency) markets look to have topped, yada yada GME bullish, buy and hodl, pretty pictures, no cell no sell üöÄ üåä
