Greetings 🦍, hope you all had a nice week-end. In this DD I will give you my opinion on the current FUD situation regarding our favorite stock, aswell as my price prediction and target based on my own due diligence and research. I've also included TA from [Tradespotting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI24I7XHA2yY4Fs-pVmplpA) and [Trading Sciences](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuSZPMtuCptWvnC7fGCzzjw) who are in my opinion knowledgable traders with different opinions and methods. As always everything will be a simple as possible to understand and straight to the point.

Part 1 : It's impossible, GIVE UP !

Naysayers : one who denies, refuses, opposes, or is skeptical or cynical about something, there are always naysayers who say it can't be done.

As of today the narrative toward us has not changed, as we grow in numbers and as our POSITIONS increase, so does the hate we receive. it's not that they care about your investment or your money. They would just fucking hate to see you succeed and come out on the side winning of a twist of fate.\
🎲

They talk alot, and I mean alot of games for people who can't even put(S) their money where their mouth is. Pay no mind to these backseat paper handed investors, the plan has never changed and will never change. BUY + HODL. 🚀

For your sake don't listen to people who have no stake in the game, trust yourself and your intuition/DD. If you decide to buy/sell do it on your own accord, don't listen to me or anybody. If you need the capital don't starve yourself to death, hold what you can only .

*Let me put it this way, if you are extremly over leveraged or in a bad spot fiancialy, their propaganda will be that much effective. I'm currently holding XX because I can't afford more and that is perfectly fine with me.*

We need hype, we need STRONG APES. Personally I will NEVER EVER give up on my shares until the price is right and I will add slowly to my position every two weeks, and in due time we will we take everything they have stolen from us with their fraud, we will take the company and the jobs they tried to erase to the fucking MOON.

Slow and steady wins the race 🐢

*It was never be going an easy fight going up agaisnt these people but i'm proud of everyone single one of you.*

To conclude my introduction and transition into my next segment, I will leave you with this absolute slapper of a [speech](https://youtu.be/qW2hjhN3mZs?t=69) by Tradespotting ;

Part 2 : Twist Of Fate (Historical Volatility TA by Tradespotting)

Historical volatility (HV) is a statistical measure of the [dispersion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dispersion.asp) of returns for a given security or [market index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp) over a given period of time. Generally, this measure is calculated by determining the average deviation from the [average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averageprice.asp) of a financial instrument in the given time period. Using [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) is the most common, but not the only, way to calculate historical volatility. The higher the historical volatility value, the riskier the security. However, that is not necessarily a bad result as risk works both ways---bullish and bearish.

This signal went off last year around July , it's very rare that it goes off.

The last time it happened it took the price UP 100%.

Shout-out to Tradespotting for his awesome speech and finding out about this indicator.

Part 3 : MOAW : Mother Of All Wedges (revisited)

The first day we broke out of the MOAW GME plunged, in my opinion this was done on purpose to attack investor psychologically (HO NO ! It's breaking on the downside )

Nevertheless ever since that day we've been on a run, because guess what ? None of you beautiful APES bought their bluff . The MOAW ended up being a self fullfiling prophecy confirming our bullish momentum.

GME breaking out the MOAW on the upside.

Part 4 : MACDaddy II

We just had the MACD turn green again. This alone is not a guarantee by any mean as a proof of that the last time it occured it ended up being a fake breakout.

Will it be different this time ? No way to tell for sure, but it's definetly something to keep an eye on and as long as GME remain above 173$ we are BULLISH.

Shorts don't want us past the 188$ level because historically they tend to lose control on the price action.

MACD turning gree again, hopefully this time we see a strong move.

Will we break out above 188$ next week ?

Part 4 : Elliot Waves and Fibonnacies (TA by Trading Sciences)

What is Elliot Waves Theory ? <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elliottwavetheory.asp>

What are Fibs (Fibonnaci retracement) ? <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp>

I'm not the biggest fan of Elliot Waves but I think it's something worth talking about ,and also something we can look back on afterward to see how accurate it ended up being.

As far as fibs are concerned they highlight very strategic level (Historically) on GME that Hedgies tend to look at.

anything between the 0.38 and 0.5 (230$ - 280$) is what you could call the lava zone for them (MARGIN CALLS 📞)

Elliot Wave in relationship with the HV indicator I mentioned earlier.

According to Elliot Waves we should be hitting 195$ next week then get rejected back to our current level only to make a HUGE move up to our previous high (500$+) around the mid July. Get rejected once more to the 200's to finally gap up 🚀 and start squeezing in September/November.

On the second picture you will see that the indicator shown in Part II (HV) seem to go hand in hand with Elliot Waves theory, this is why I like to use different sources and analyst to confirm my bias.

*Elliot Wave theory TA Trading Sciences explain why his medium term price target for GameStop is 800$+ and how we will reach it. **IN DEPTH***\

Final part: Price prediction, TLDR and conclusion

My price target for GME 2021 :

June : 188 - 220$

July : 220$ - 300$

August : 300 - 500$

September/November/December : 500$ - 800$++++ (Gamme Squeeze into Short Squeeze)

TLDR : BUY + HODL + vote. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose otherwise FUD becomes effective, look out for your brother and sister apes. This is my own opinion based on my own DD, not financial advice. Expect volatility and strong moves very soon on GME. If you chose to interact with shills do it in the mindset that they are not Nostradamus and can't predict the future more than you do, they just have a bearish 🐻 bias.

GME TO THE MOON 🚀
