Greetings 🦍 I wanted to do a quick follow up on my last [*DD*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n2witz/wen_moon_taddelliot_wavegamma_squeezeoptions/) and give my opinion on what happened today and how it relates to my previous post. Also wanted to say thanks to everybody who took the time to read it, special shout out to those who gave awards. I will release part 3 next week-end to recap the week and give a review on how everything turned out. Once again this is gonna be straight to the point.

You can check out Part 1 [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n2witz/wen_moon_taddelliot_wavegamma_squeezeoptions/)

Part 1 : GUH ?

This morning large funds and their agents tried to short us into oblivion in an attempt to slow down our bullish momentum (What's behind 180 Kenny ?), we were breaking out the wedge ahead of schedual and they just couldn't let it happen. **(***See for yourself in the picture below)*. You can also see that their first attempt on may 30th wasn't succesful so they knew they had to go hard this time. In the next part, I will explain why I believe it doesn't matter as much as you'd think and why I believe it's desperation.

GUH?! really Kenny ?

Part 1 : The Unbreakable Trend Line

Ever since February Hedgies haven't been able to break the trendline represented by the **THICC dotted yellow line. (**also the bottom part of the wedge) Meaning, that agaisnt all odds we've been on a slow and steady climb. I believe this is due to the fact that we've doing such a great job at buying + holding 🚀 , (*as you can see from the pictures below)* , it's been a constant battle but we refused to gave them an inch.

The fight started to turn in our favor so they bombarded the shit out us this morning. this THICC line should be our launching pad, shorts want this to be the the edge of the world and make us crash down.

As you can see, even after today brutal attack we're still on course to break out. HOLDING STRONG as always. We don't like dates so much around here, but this week and cinqo de buyo *(shoutout to whoever came up with that name)* will be decisive *IMO* . *When in doubt Just zoom out bro*

Part 3 : What's next ??? Wen moon ???

If we continue to trade above the THICC YELLOW LINE like we've been doing ever since February we will eventually see 200$ again 🐢, like I said in my previous *DD* Hedgies don't want that for obvious reasons.

I would expect the more of the same tommorow. Huge sell-off at open with us playing catch up all day trying to keep our head above water. Their goal will be to sink us below *154$, doing that would break the trendline for the first time and make us deviate from our momentum.* Expect fuckery and as always. BUY+HOLD 🙌 💎

If we manage to stay on course and break out the trendline on the 5th/6th with some decent volume, the stock could get really explosive like we all know it can.

*As always feel free to comment if you disagree, or if you want to say thanks it is much appreciated.*

This is only my personal opinion and not financial advice.
