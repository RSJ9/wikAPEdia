Greetings once again 🦍 , what a week it has been, I hope your tits are as jacked as mine . Once again we achieved what they said couldn't be done, smashing expectations resulting in [Millions of $ lost by short sellers.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/gamestop-and-amc-s-wednesday-rally-hand-shorts-673-million-loss) This long week-end is the perfect opportunity to regroup, re-focus and prepare ourselves for the what is coming. It's okay to be feel confident and be happy about our results but like the late great Kobe Bryant said *''Job's not done''.*

If you missed out on the action, we opened the week at *180$ bulldozing trought sell walls and closing at 222$ on friday after a brutal short attack.* A truly desperate move by short sellers and market makers to prevent the massive amount of 250$ Calls to finish ITM (In the money) . This would have been a disaster, if 🦍 didn't HOLD and had stop losses set up. Not only did we mitigate the crash but we landed in a perfect spot for next week buyers, finishing the week UP 40$ (+25,57%).

We also completed Wave 1 of Elliot, heading into Wave 2 next week.

OOF ! What a week for GameStop! UP 40$ (+25,57%) with a high of 268$.

ASCENSION : Technical Analysis

*1\. Fibonnaci Retreacement + Elliot Waves*

We completed Wave 1 of Elliot with a high of 268.80$ (BULLISH), right now we are looking for Wave 2meaning we are looking for a a retreacement (low) between 218$ - 187$, once we find that low we will bounce back up, the higher is our low the crazier the bounce back will be. In my analysis I used the worst case scenario of 187$ish as I like to stay conservative with numbers. To give you a good perspective here's what the next move could look like. Using Fibonnaci Extension we can estimate what the next move is gonna be (it's actually insane) but see for yourself on the second picture.

Wave 1 Completed, Wave 2 in completion and Wave 3 is 🚀

Wave 3 is gonna blow people socks off ( 300 - 780$ )

2\. When to Buy The Dip (Swim with with Wales)

This part really concerns X,XX APES more than others because some of you might want to buy a few more times before we rocket and it get too expensive. Perfectly understandable, so I will give you the levels to buy. Keep in mind long 🐳 know these level and they will buy aswell. As small fishes we wanna swim alongside them and let them carry us to our destination. You don't want to miss these prices simply because you might never see them again. 🐳

You could set alarm at these prices and be ready to buy when it hits, keep in mind it could very well bounce monday at opening or friday at close, there's no way to know for sure when wave 2 will be completed, just keep these prices in mind. 187$ would be an insane snipe as I believe 180$ is the floor, 237ish$ is your LAST CHANCE. don't miss out !!!! 187$ - 203$ - 217$ - 237$.

187$ - 203$ - 217$ - 237$

3\. Long Ladder Attack (Stairway to heaven) / HV (180$ is the new Floor)

I know this term doesn't really exist but I just wanted to call it that way for lack of a better one, basically it's just a staircase to andromeda with every candle being bigger and gaining more momentum and volume due to short covering. It could start looking something like this from the monthly view. I think this is were we are heading, straight to the moon. Looking at it long term make it seem way more feasible and less crazy, just remember the upside is limitless. It's also in my believe that anything above 500$ is GAME OVER.

The staircase to Andromeda

Regarding (HV)

*Historical volatility (**HV**) is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index over a given period of time. Generally, this measure is calculated by determining the average deviation from the average price of a financial instrument in the given time period*.

This is very rare signal, and I touched on it my briefly in my [last DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/njdu1z/wen_moon_iv_twist_of_fate_psychological/), it is in my understanding that once this signal is given before a period of volatility these prices are never seen again. It was given once in July 2020 before the initial run up in January and has been given again in previous weeks. Meaning we are probably looking at another huge gap up but this time RH won't be able to shut it down.

Shoot out to youtuber [Tradespotting](https://youtu.be/4Y9dTCr98xY?t=200) for figuring this one out.
