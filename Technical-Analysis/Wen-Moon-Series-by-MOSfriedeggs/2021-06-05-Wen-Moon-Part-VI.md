Greeting 🦍 ! What an awesome surprise we had with the return of DFV 🐱 his meme game is still on point and it feels great to know he's still with us. Amazing week overall for us in term of price action. As far as news nothing too crazy except the infamous [freudian slip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_slip) from Ms. Lee confirming what all apes around the world already knew. Sit back grab a drink and let me guide you through what's coming up next week for us. Again this doesn't take into account 6/9 or other possible future announcements as it's impossible to predict the effect they would have on people.

In the *TLDR* you will find my *TIERLIST* of entries for this week aswell as my price prediction for the future, those have remained mostly unchanged as I still feel like our pace is pretty much the same. 🚀

HE'S BACK !!!! 🐱

Part 1 : Weekly Recap

After a long week-end everybody was excited for opening of the casino and not only did we get an awesome week, we got a long awaited DFV tweet on tuesday.

We took the most bullish path into the strong move I predicted last week, kissing 294$ in what seemed like an unstopabble thrust , until an absolute BRUH MOMENT put a screeching STOP to our momentum when it was clear APES were in total control. If you saw what happened live it almost seemed unreal. *AMC* halt *and we began what seemed like a clear move to 300$+ only to be shutdown a second before.* It was very nasty to watch, but on a positive note it was a pure FLEX from $GME. The rest of the week was pretty quiet and friday ended up being like every friday (a slow bleed) by market makers to stop as many Call Options to go BRRRR$$.

Nevertheless it was an epic week for the most part, proud of all of you APES STILL BUYING AND HODLING !!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

NAKED SHORT , YAH !!!

Part 2 : Trend / Elliot Waves / Fibonaccis

The higher highs and lower lows we are setting on the current trending move looks very good and healthy, not much to say about that except to watch carefully if this continue to develop into next week, if we remain above 240$ for the rest of next week consider us extremly bullish.

Last week I talked about Elliot Waves and how we would dip a bit an then our next move would be fucking amazing and it was IMO taking us all the way from 226$ to nearly 300$ in a short trading week. In believe we completed wave 1 - 2 - 3 this week and possibly 4, this will be confirmed very soon. Don't forget 6/9 although hard to quantify, might have very positive effect on the price action.

Below you will find crayon drawings with all my scenarios. I used fibs to give me more accurate price target and levels to watch for.

Last week prediction, things turned out even more BOOLISH than I thought.

My favorite scenario; a bounce of that .618 Fib from this week move up, straight into the 5th wave reaching 300$+++

Possible 290+$ EOW ? 390ISH$ is the target nevertheless .

This scenario isn't as bullish but we could end up catching ourselves lower and bounce off 235$ or even as low as 220 into 300$+++. STILL STUNNING 🚀

NEVER FORGET, WEN IN DOUBT ZOOM OUT O_O

FUCK I LOVE THIS STONK

Part 3 : TLDR , Price Prediction and Entry level.

TLDR :\
Wanted to keep things as brief as possible in this edition because next week is right around the corner and I don't want to speculate too much since 6/9 (lul) good or bad will most def. have an impact on the stonk. But nevertheless I still think we will start trading near 300$ very very soon.

Expect more of the same by hedgies, but it's getting harder and harder for them to short us. Because make no mistake if they could they would take us back to 118$ no doubt (STILL GOT PTSD FROM THAT DAY)

AS ALWAYS BUY + HODL 🦍

I would tell you to vote but.. if you havent by now WTF ???

Can't wait for the vote count to be released. O_O

HYPED UP TO THE MAXIMUM LFG

Best entry point for next week :

~~187$~~ ~~(unlikely)~~ MUST BUY !!!!!!!

220-227$ (God tier)

237$ (Decent if available)

245 - 250 $ (if you are impatient or just want to buy now ) -

265$-275$ (If it starts ripping)

Updated price target for GME 2021 :

June : 220 - 260+ (strong resistance at 250)

July : 280 - 350+ (Picking up some APES along the way)

August : 350+ - 500$ (This is where they will use the aces up their sleeve)

September : 500$ (huge battle) - ♾ INFINITY $ (GG REKT)
