[DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

Greetings to all APES from around the 🌎🚀 in light of the recent events regarding price action and the massive FUD campaign orchestrated agaisnt us by the legacy media and shills, I have decided to post this DD ahead of schedual to try and make people less prone to FUD by taking the focus away from emotions back the to the numbers and the current trajectory we are on at the moment. The more detached we stay from our emotions in trading the better IMO. Shills want you to be emotional, they want you to feel isolated and down, I will explain how they do it and how to avoid falling into their trap. In this DD I've also included alot of TA because if there's one thing I will always trust, it's my tools. The rest is noise and B.S.

PART 1 : FUD CAMPAIGN + 5M share offering ATM

*FUD CAMPAIGN*

One of the oldest trick in the book from Wallstreet and their agents is to dip the price on earnings day, not only for GME but for alot of other stock aswell. Earnings create alot of FUD in some investors over a short period of time and they love to capitalize on that for their own personal agenda. They will have their articles ready, massively short the stock and will have shills spread disinformation online. Yesterday we saw this textbook play unfold in front of our eyes.

I want you to pay attention to the graph below these two FUD articles , you will see that Gamestop diped on every (E) day because of manipulation and paper handed bitches, only to come back stronger afterward. Again, toying with people emotions on the short term to get them to panic. Stock price improved in between every earning why would it be different this time ?

Stock price improved in between every earning why would it be different this time ? Especially with the new team we've got at GME.

*5M share offering ATM*

Shills pushed the narrative that this was bad for us, I want you to listen to this amazing [video](https://youtu.be/etuR9yOyE_s?t=60) by Tradespotting where he debunks that narrative completly. Brilliant, if you are feeling worried about those 5M shares watch the video.

It's over, pack it up guys.

PART 2 : WEN IN DOUBT ZOOM OUT + exponential floor tracking chart (credit : [u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/))

Another strategy used by shills and other clowns hiding in the deepest corner of the meltdown subreddit will be to Zoom-in and use stupid line charts to make you doubtful.

*''See bagholders GME is going down, sell now before you lose everything''*

They want you to think about today's drop and fuck with your emotions , they want you to forget this incredible period of accumulation, the incredible and growing community of APES, the complete overhaul of the company, DFV still holding with us, and real TA like what i'm about to show you . We will never ever give up, we buy and we hodl the plan hasn't changed. 🚀

*''it's a failing brick and mortar stock and the stock going back to 40$''*

come again f*** head I haven't heard this one before.

Well well well, I wonder what's behind 350$.

William O'Neil's Cup with Handle is a bullish continuation pattern that marks a consolidation period followed by a breakout. ... The cup forms after an advance and looks like a bowl or rounding bottom 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

Ask yourself this question, did today really mattered in the grand scheme of things ?

PART 3 : Fibonaccis

In the section below you will find historical fibs from GME, it's crazy how accurately it predicted the future, this is one of my favorite tool to use to see what might happen next with the price action. Because of all the people who use the Fibonacci tool, those levels become self-fulfilling.

*See for yourself.*

Retracement :

Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate the possible support and resistance levels where price could potentially reverse direction.

Pay attention to this pattern repeating itself over and over on GME , every time there's a major dip we bounce of the .5 fib and use the subsequent .236/.382 as our support and we consolidate there, this is bullish.

*All time high -*

[![r/Superstonk - wen moon 7 : The Show Must Go On (Earnings/TA/Prices+Entries)](https://preview.redd.it/d6jkfae26j471.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef554f378d3c87f84a300dd0c96cc62dbbf5317d)](https://preview.redd.it/d6jkfae26j471.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef554f378d3c87f84a300dd0c96cc62dbbf5317d)

Price bounced off the .5 from our all time high ! .236 has become an amazing support level for us, impossible to break for the hedgies.

*MARCH -*

[![r/Superstonk - wen moon 7 : The Show Must Go On (Earnings/TA/Prices+Entries)](https://preview.redd.it/577m0mr17j471.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=304e8887ca4b01f5f84f1e147432bd178c6cfd3e)](https://preview.redd.it/577m0mr17j471.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=304e8887ca4b01f5f84f1e147432bd178c6cfd3e)

.5 Bounce , using .236 and .382 as support

June -

[![r/Superstonk - wen moon 7 : The Show Must Go On (Earnings/TA/Prices+Entries)](https://preview.redd.it/0zyu83rg8j471.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=c82b94090a48951d0201ce52a2119222e1f2cf99)](https://preview.redd.it/0zyu83rg8j471.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=c82b94090a48951d0201ce52a2119222e1f2cf99)

Once again price bounced off the .5 and will try to break out the prior .233 / .382 support.

Now that have identified our lows lets look at our future highs using the extension tool.

Fibonaccis Extention

Fibonacci extensions are a tool that traders can use to establish or estimate how far a price may travel after a retracement is finished.

All time -

*The ideal extension from our all time is somewhere between 500 - 900$ I will demonstrate how it will happen in the next section using Elliot Wave.*

[![r/Superstonk - wen moon 7 : The Show Must Go On (Earnings/TA/Prices+Entries)](https://preview.redd.it/vbrv2br69j471.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f26d83b6b64be57b9cc33905c03ea1c51f203b)](https://preview.redd.it/vbrv2br69j471.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f26d83b6b64be57b9cc33905c03ea1c51f203b)

This is where GME is going next 500+ - 800+$, since we broke the .236 on our move up reaching the .618 seems inevitable to me.

JUNE

*Same logic applies here, once we break the .236 we will get a higher high between the .5 / .618 fib a.k.a 350+$*

Same logic apply to our latest move up , we pull back and then bounce back.

Part 3 : ELLIOT WAVE

I've talked alot about Elliot wave in my previous DD, I like this theory even thought it's more useful to daytrader it can help us see the path ahead. On the first picture you will see the prediction made last week by Youtuber Trading Sciences, as you can see he was pretty close. The green lines show the actual updated price.

On the second frame you will my own prediction with the updated price of today.

Wave 1 (completed) 135 -­ 344 - Wave 2 (completed) 344 - 211 - Wave 3 (forming) 211 - 483 - Wave 4 (prediction) 344 - 800$

Prediction made last week by Trading Sciences, pretty accurate.

Look out Ken, the rocket is coming your way

Part 4 : TLDR , Price Prediction and Entry level.

Shills will never divide us.
