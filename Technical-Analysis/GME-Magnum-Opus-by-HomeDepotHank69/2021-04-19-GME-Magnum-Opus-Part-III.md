Greetings apes, please see¬†[my post from yesterday where I use my hypothesis that GME is repeating its early January price and volume action.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtf4e4/gme_magnum_opus_dd_past_present_future/)¬†YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT IT. This is based on the idea that GME has been in a nasty FTD cycle since last year, so we can use previous prices to predict future prices. Again, do not take this as fact and do not get tied to predictions. This is simply my opinion based on my research and it very well could be wrong. I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.

Update on the Theory

To recap, my thesis is that GME is currently following the same price action as early January (exact dates from January below) and that because of that, it will be following this same pattern:

I currently believe that GME is in the exact same spot as it was in on January 11th. Here is my data backing that up:

GME price and volume action from 12/28-1/8 and 4/5 - 4/16:

This is a summation of what I posted yesterday. The crux of this is that price and volume have been fractally repeating because of the FTD cycle and that the price repetitions are now uncanny. We can see that last Wednesday - Friday is almost identical to the Wed - Fri January time frame that I covered. If this theory is correct, then today (4/19) should follow the same price and volume action as 1/11. AND WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS (1/11):

This shows a significant gap up in price and volume. The gap up in price is not higher than the price was before the week-long dip. Here, you can see exactly the same thing is happening today (at 10am). Obviously, the day is not finished so this is incomplete, however, there was a gap up in price that was not higher than prior to the week-long dip. Though it appears that volume is lower, it's only 10am and volume is on pace to be significantly higher than both Thursday and Friday, just like 1/11:

More similarities

In my previous post, I said that the 1/11 increase was due to an SEC filing about GME. Here's that filing:¬†<https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html>

The filing is about accelerating their digital transformation and making changes to their leadership. TODAY, we got information that GME's CEO would be stepping down soon. This rise also might have been on the tailwinds of DFVs epic double-down. Either way, the catalysts were similar. Notably, this was one of the last major catalysts in January, and the price simply rose due to media coverage and momentum alone, which is why I called it the start of the squeeze (the point of no return).

The future

If my theory is correct, then tomorrow should be an extremely flat day in terms of price (should be slightly negative) and volume should decrease significantly. The peak of the week should be on Wednesday, which should be characterized by an almost unseen increase in volume and the biggest single-day price increase in months. Then, volume should taper off slightly the rest of the week while price continues to rise (but not rapidly). If all of this happens, then we are weeks away from the MOASS. Again, this is just a theory, do not take it as fact.
