I watched the first 4.5 hours of the stream. For those who have no yet watched, I'll try and post what I have gleaned from the stream. This is from memory so some things may be incorrect. I'm probably missing things since I can't remember EVERYTHING from the mere 4.5 hours I have watched. Incoming wall of text:

Origins: DOMO was established in 2007 with Mr. Justin Dopierala and one of his investment professors. DOMO is a combination of DO(Dopierala) and MO (Mo-something haha). Justin bought out his partner though he is still a client of DOMO. Justin started investing money from friends, family, and his alma mater. His reputation increased and he took on clients to the point of where he is today.

-   He claims that he invests his money exactly how he invests his client. His portfolio is similar to that of his clients. He claims that most of his money/assets are invested.

-   DOMO is run by 2 people including himself. He is considering adding on advisors should the need arise following the events of GME.

-   He states that he initially bought in GME at $2 and sold at $40. He states that he does have a fiduciary duty to his clients. This would mean he has to put his clients' interests above his own.

-   DOMO is NOT a hedge fund. He states he doesn't know enough rich people to be a hedge fund anyway.

-   He states he finds it easier to stay true to retail investors since he's not in a big city and doesn't have to worry about all the bougie things that go on in big cities - like fancy dinners where Wall Street big wigs talk about non-public info.

-   He states that he hasn't really bought back into GME due to the type of invest his company is looking for. With GME being volatile, he is looking for something under valued and can be a safe bet profit lock in. This is not to be misconstrued as GME not being profitable but just not quite the fit for his company and his clients.

-   He believes some hedgies and GME has been squeezed in January. He neither confirms nor denies the possibility of a second GME squeeze. He points out that other stocks have had multiple squeezes and that GME could potentially be squeezed a second time but he doesn't know. Please note he is conservative in this wording and makes no claims.

-   He has spoken to Ryan Cohen in the past and thinks his investor relations department needs to step up haha.

-   He thinks Game Stop is smart for being quiet in these times. This means Game Stop is not telegraphing its moves. Can't read into things if there's nothing to read.

-   He is a religious person who believes in God and his favorite Bible verse is John 3:16, which is what he posted on Easter.

-   He does NOT let his religious views get in the way of his business practice. If you are kind, polite, and not an asshole, he doesn't care. Be respectful to him and his company and he will be respectful to you.

-   He doesn't smoke weed though he doesn't care or judge people who do.

-   You don't need to prove you own GME to invest the lower amount of $100,000. He says "if you know, you know." Meaning if you know about the lower entry price, you good.

-   He is looking to expanding his clients to Canada but there are tax and logistical issues, as each province needs a registration or something like that.

-   He is not currently looking to expand to Europe. He states that it is less beneficial to clients due to the amount of taxes they would face. If a client could make more money investing elsewhere and not having a large amount lost to taxes if they were to invest with him, he would rather his that client not invest with him. (I will note, this is consistent with claims to fiduciary duty. He could gladly take his cut while you're getting taxed but he points out that you'd probably make more by avoiding the tax rates that it would cost to invest with him.)

-   He trades stocks. He does not short or mess with options.

-   He cautions when doing DD about institutional ownership, to be careful as the data is usually old data. Positions can change so be cautious with using sources for institutional ownership.

-   He doesn't claim to know everything about GME. He does believe in Ryan Cohen and says he's extremely smart. He states that RC knows a lot about the knitty gritty details of Game Stop. RC doesn't manage from an ivory tower but gets in the "weeds" - aka he looks at the fine details.

-   He doesn't know what kind of mergers Game Stop could attempt. He does say that if Game Stop took a type of gambling approach a la Fantasy Football but for E-sports, Justin thinks that could be profitable. To clarify, for tourneys or what not, people could bet on who they think could win. Game Stop could potentially be a HUB to provide analytics and data on each individual pro player so that people betting could check stats and make informed bets.

-   His favorite crayon is "blueberry." He even showed it on stream. As a fan of the color blue, more specifically indigo blue, I respect this.

-   He doesn't mind pineapple on pizza but it's not something he would order himself. He likes cheese, pepperoni, and fresh sliced mushrooms.

-   When he cooks, he likes to grill. Grilled chicken + salad, grilled pork + salad, grilled meat + salad.

-   He has never received any threats by people or MSM. He also thinks MSM is bullshit since they tend to have their own agenda.

-   He is in the process of being featured in a GME documentary by Submarine Studios. He wants the real story of GME being told and not some agenda-spewing BS that MSM or Hulu would make.

-   He doesn't really think the economy is gonna crash.

My personal opinion of the 4.5 hours I have watched: Justin Dopierala (JD) comes off genuine to me. He is not afraid to admit when he doesn't know something. He is unabashed in his views and tells it like it is. He address questions that asked/stated he was going off the hype to build reputation with the community to snag in investors. He denies this and says his fiduciary duties led him to do what he had to do. People have consistently asked "why should we trust you after what he have seen the hedge funds do" to which he stated that he isn't a hedge fund, he stays true to himself, and it's up to you make that decision on whether to trust or not. Nothing he does or say can convince you because if you're biased and non-trusting, is anything he says or does really going to convince you?

He appears genuine and I for one would considering investing ~~if~~ when I have the money. I may invest in other fiduciaries as well. And that's another thing. He claims to be a fiduciary and adhere to fiduciary duties. Regarding this, I see little conflict of interest IF his portfolio is exactly that of his clients. Making money off commission is pretty much non-existent if there's only 2 people at the company. I can't see how he would invest everyone in a stock and make commission off of it if he's the only employee to begin with. He does have his Series 63 license which is consistent with fiduciaries. DOMO as has an ADV filing which MAY also consistent with fiduciary filings though I'm not sure if this ENSURES his role as a fiduciary. I don't see a Series 7 license but I'd just probably have to ask him to know what licenses/certificates he has, should my search be inadequate.

Lastly, when asked what allowed him to call out MSM for their bullshit while others have cowered in fear, he said "I just don't give a shit." I liked that. I liked that a lot. Stick to you guns. He did. He also streamed his AMA for 6 hours so that says something about commitment. He answered live. Nothing to hide. No "I wrote an article about it. Read it here!" type shit.

Edit: Corrected Dopierala's favorite Bible verse from Joseph 3:16 to John 3:16. Credit to z-eldapin for the correction.

Edit 2: Thanks for the award! I don't post all that much so it's unusual for me to see my post in a red box haha. Now if I could only get in some other red boxes IRL haha.

Edit 3: Changed Dopierala's topping from "fresh sliced mustards" to "fresh sliced mushrooms." Credit Solid_steve89 for this correction. I was confused to as why someone would put a mustard plant on a pizza haha. Who am I to question someone's choice of toppings haha. Mushrooms makes a lot sense though haha.
