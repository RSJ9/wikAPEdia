OC by DFDD

Let me first thank everyone who works hard on DD that breaks down numbers and regulations to a palpable morsel so that the necessary information that we all need to stay informed doesn't nosedive off of my brain like a slide lubed with astroglide.

What I don't see enough of though is psychological DD. These are my humble observations of human patterns and emotions as a diligent DeepFriedDonkeyApe, and I would like to address them in hopes of not just solidifying diamond hands for the MOASS, but diamond nerves for the after times when the poor ape problems are switched out for the rich ape problems.(Like Puff Daddy famously once said, "MOASS MO PROBLEMS")

In order to do that, I believe we need to openly discuss issues of basic human psychology and societal structures that are in place to keep us blind and dumb to our own devices

Emotional Fatigue

Some of you will be teetering on the precipice of being paper-handed bitches regardless of your post history pledging allegiance to the diamond hands club and upvoting every meme ridiculing the evil hedgey overlords. We are all heading into a massive shift. The DD points to it, the writing is on the wall. It is unprecedented at this magnitude, and you are not emotionally prepared for what is coming. Emotional fatigue comes into play regardless if the choices that are being made are positive or negative. It's the fact that you will need to make a constant stream of high risk, high reward choices if you choose not to pull yourself away from the screen once MOASS kicks off. Furthermore, it's that these are not just some basic input/output choices, these will be highly emotionally charged choices at every moment the price changes either up or down.

Imagine this scenario if you will. "OMG MOASS IS BLASTING OFF! I NEED TO HODL! I AM STRONG APE! OMG OMG IT'S PASSED 10K, HODL FOR MY APE BROTHERS AND SISTERS! 100K LET'S GOOOO!!! ... it dipped to 80K... is this it?? Did I miss the peak! Is this the way down? If I don't sell now I will be a bag holder, and I won't be able to afford my dog's braces!!? BACK UP OVER 100K!! Maybe I should sell 1 share now, it won't hurt! I just don't wanna be a bagholder and I want to prove to everyone I was right!!This is what the hedgies want. They are stupid, but they also aren't stupid."

Even too much of a good thing will wear you down, and when you are mentally and emotionally worn down, it would be easy for you to be susceptible to a close friend or family member's suggestions to SELL because all they see are big numbers and not the DD and community that supports this movement and our true value. Or say you go online and happen to stumble upon a shill post, or a shill messages you directly, and since you are already burnt out from your emotional high they can more easily suggest for you to sell under the guise of guidance.

Remember, these assholes were born or indoctrinated early on into this kind of money and mentality. These types of figures are childs play to them, but to us who were born on the other side of the spectrum, it will be emotional, and exhausting even on the way up.

Business is NEVER "just" business

Why am I so certain of that? Who run's business? Who manages all the wealth that flows through the oily tacked fingers of the world? We do, people, humans with brains. Brains that are fueled by thoughts and emotions. Emotions that can be easily swayed if you are unprepared. The wall street assholes have been trying to manipulate us emotionally and during the squeeze they will be ramping up their efforts to save their own asses as much as possible.

Greed

We are up against some of the greediest mother-FUDders on this planet. From what I see, the ape sentiment is not entirely to combat greed with greed (although a little greed is prescribed) but to combat it with our smart math and science ape's DD, and with the collective empathy of the everyday ape because most of us want better for this world. Be empathetically greedy. Remember, They have more money than you have brain cells, and will use that advantage tooth and nail until our collective overflowing diligence and patience prevails.

You will be manipulated

If not now by some hedge fuckery, then later on by people in your inner or outer circles and you should prepare for that. I understand that we want to think the best of the people we keep in our lives, but I reiterate again, We are about to be catapulted, not baby stepped, into heights we have never dealt with before. It will affect not just us, but the people around us for better or worse. Money doesn't change people, money will just amplify who we already were. Insecurities, distrust, greed, jealousy, and much more will be directed straight at your big sparkly eyes. Regardless of your best intentions, which will amount to very little up against the mountain of FUD people deal with on a daily basis.

There is a great post that I looked back on fondly that gave real world proof of this from the perspective of lottery winners.

Someone had posted this in a GME thread a while back, and all I saw in the replies were the same sentiments of, "That's so depressing." To me, it's valuable information. It's reality, and a necessary reality we need to come to grips with. For your sake and the sake of the ones you wish to bring up with you. I'm not promoting paranoia or full scale distrust of everyone, just a little more self reflection about the reality of this situation post MOASS and what you might need to prepare yourself for. Guilt and fear have been the bedrock of a lot of our childhoods.

Parents and close friends sometimes use these tactics to manipulate us into doing things we don't want to, but exclaim that it's in your best interest. Being firm and learning to say no will be your strongest tool. Set up trust funds, talk to financial advisers and lawyers of established businesses and high profile personalities to help you through this. Just wishing well, and hoping that your good intentions will make everything right as rain is a slippery slope in it of itself. We are empathetic, but don't let it be your downfall.

There is a time for yes, and a time for no. You will have to learn as you go but understand that money will not fix everything, in some cases it will make things worse and you need to prepare for those instances because you will not be able to control all the variables when it comes to other people's emotional stability.

Accountability

We were born into a rigged social system, but the problems in your lives are not solely the result of the powdered wig and powdered nosed debutants that sit on high. I get that the narrative has to be an US VS THEM for the troops to rally, but understand where you need to keep yourself accountable for the way things are in your life, especially where they are unfavorable. You will still need to hold yourself accountable for all the good and bad things that come after, and money won't fix all of your fuck ups, only your character can do that. I personally don't hate any of the hedge fucks, that's a waste of energy for me and I don't care to keep tabs on them other than knowing a general idea so I stay informed.

I honestly feel a little sorry for them, that this is how they see life, on a shallow plane that constantly needs to be filled with even shallower tastes that never last. They were once kids as we all were, and somehow they were led to believe that taking advantage of an entire financial system was the right thing to do, and too see the rest of us as less than. Now that doesn't make it any less hilarious when they are bled dry of all their money and I sure as hell will hold well past orbit to see that happen. Hopefully someday, the 2nd coming of Ape Jesus will reform the hedgies, until then I will hold myself accountable for where my life currently is, accept my mistakes, and strive to learn and grow as I Scrooge McDuck my naked ass into my mountain of money.

Emotional Intelligence

Understand this, emotional intelligence is different from mental intelligence. With the latter, you can acquire knowledge and for the most part, apply in real time. With emotions though, it is majorly the opposite because you cannot force the applicable tests to occur naturally. Sure you can yell and scream at people to see if you can get reactions out of them, but the subtleties of emotional growth go deeper than that. It will be your direct split second reaction to the triggers in your life that will show whether you have truly grown or not, and you may fail, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again before the neural pathways in your brain have finally let go of their old guidance system.

When you no longer react, and see clearly where you want to move next without impatience or fear, then you will know that you have learned. My point being, don't beat yourself up if you do feel like paper-handing, or you fuck up somehow along the way because acquiring diamond hands may takes more than just slinging emojis and upvotes within a few weeks, or months for some of us. Hold yourself accountable, look yourself in the face and blow yourself a juicy kiss, and keep going.

It's ok if you aren't DFV. You can't just point to Jesus(DFV) and say BE CHRIST LIKE. That is a nice sentiment that will give you the warm and jigglies in your staunches for the night, but is literally unattainable for the majority of the populace unless they put in the hard mental work to be the new Ape Jesus! You also have to understand, personality is both nurtured and natured. Some people are born wired a very specific and different way than you are. Some emotions are vastly more attainable and abundant for others because the pathways in their brains allow for it to be so. You can attain it too, but it takes A LOT MORE WORK to get there. You will need to commit this to rote memory when you flair up and fuck up again and again, and takes those failures with a shit eating grin and learn little by little because you need to learn to give yourself love and grace in order to emotionally evolve.

What can we do?

There will be many outside the reddit bubble that don't have the support system that we do, and will paperhands. Which will then dip the price and cause some to panic, that is inevitable. Which makes it even more pertinent for all of the GME reddit sphere to HODL and hodl each other if we need a hairy ape shoulder to rely on. As long as we outnumber the paperhands, our cosmic course will not falter.

For others The best thing you can do is do NOTHING, as in prepare, then do nothing until the right time. You have to be honest with yourself with this one and come to terms if you will undoubtedly be way too emotional on the way up to be able to think clearly, know who to trust, and every rise and dip will have your life flashing before your eyes. Set reminders on your app at specific price points (i.e. 1Mil, 10 Mil,100Mil etc.) and then wait for it to reach peak before selling on the way down.

If you feel it will help and you are able to, seek professional help to improve your mental capacity and fortitude. Therapists or psychologists can offer great methods to better understand and work through anything you need to. If that isn't available, talk to a trusted family member or friend that will not judge you and allows you the space to air out your thoughts and feelings. Don't wait until after the MOASS for this to happen, do it now so you can secure your future and those of your loved ones. Grow your support group and help others as they help you.

Accountability Apes! We all have the same goal in mind, and lots of you voice the pain of not having anyone in your immediate life to support you through this tumultuous and exciting time. I get it that there will be posts constantly yelling to HODL, but some may need a more direct line to keep them grounded via DMs, Discord, and what have you.(Note; I don't see how this would be viable unless mods or other trusted groups set this up because this could easily be manipulated by shills playing coy and friendly until MOASS hits and then they give out FUD making the ones they are in contact with sell early. If all else fails, masturbate and sleep it off, meditate, walk it off, anything other than being a cheap paperhanded whore)

Actual footage of apes supporting each other during MOASS

This is as much for me as it is for all of you. These are just my humble opinions, if a smarter ape can come up with anything else that can help guide the less confident apes I'd be happy to see it laid out. I see a lot of seasoned apes who get it, they don't really post or comment, don't care about trading sideways a few dollars here and there, don't dance at every corner and don't feel pressure when things get drawn out and we need to wait another week or 4, the DD is set and that is all that is needed.

Then there are the others who need the constant stimulus, and as much as we meme about daily bias, some of you actually do need it to feel secure in this decision. But those are the ones that are at the greater risk of emotionally folding, and the ones that outnumber the stoic and pragmatic apes. Hopefully you will make the right choices for your mental well being in order to get you to the top of tendie mountain, and for the long road ahead because the hard choices won't stop after the GME saga arc 1 has concluded.
