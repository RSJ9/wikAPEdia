[DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

Hello and good morning to all you wonderful Apes and Apettes!

With rumours of Marge a calling in the air, something just feels different this morning; so I'm taking the plunge to post this checklist on a weekday instead of this weekend. Be aware that this is non-technical in nature and a very long post, so you might want to open in a new tab if you're better off getting ready for work. TL;DR in meme form at the end!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

There are *responsible* things you need to start thinking about before, during and after the rocket takes off. Why? Because people who are known to have $$$ (e.g. announced they won the lottery) have grandkids kidnapped and threatened and worse. Some winners are killed. You probably want to read [this](https://www.ar15.com/forums/general/-/5-749519/?page=1) (<- is OG source; reposted on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vzgl/comment/chba4bf)) and start taking it seriously. Yes it's long, but don't worry, I summarized... but then needed to add good stuff so it's still long! Sorry, not sorry! This is IMPORTANT.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Before Rocket Launches

ONE. ⚠ Don't tell anyone you haven't already ⚠. Anoymity is your first and best defence. Be the millionaire next door that no one realizes is a millionaire. A Lambo, other than a rental experience, does not help here.

Have a look at this 20s video: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1t3xo/this_is_how_i_picture_the_mods_when_a_particular/>

This was an attempted kidnapping. Would you be able to respond like that? Would your spouse? Your kids? Do you want to live in a mindset where you need to be constantly aware of a building's entries, exits and where your back is facing? Proper security for known ultra-high net worth people includes things like bullet proof armored Merc with entourage picking up kids from school, significant home security, alarm dog, personal weapons and people watching (behaviours).

Starting to get uncomfortable? Good. Now go read that first link in the post you skipped.

Apes have reported getting 'offers' like: "I am sending out free headbands - just fill out the form with your info and I will mail it out!" - This is a scam. Giving them your info tells them a) You fall for this shit b) Your name & address and c) That you likely own shares. None of this is consistent with rule #1.

Free Superstonk stickers or purchasing MOASS items from anywhere online other than GameStop also falls under this 'offer'. Even if the vendors are legit, the info can be sold to a 'marketer' or hacked.

Have you been threatened? Report it! But Apes also have your back: <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcwdi1/fear_for_safetydeath_threats/>

TWO. Did you break Rule #1 before you knew it?

Figure out a good line ~> "I sold too [soon/late] and missed the peak, but I made enough to pay off my car and mortgage" This is good because it is understandable and likely to be true - the "*and never work again*" is silent. Practice telling it to the mirror because you want it believable.

Does your Reddit Avatar look like you? This is an easy fix.

THREE. BROKERS: Add your kid(s) or parents to your brokers' " account beneficiary" list. Check out your broker's sell limitations (<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml2lnw/28_and_counting_brokers_and_their_sell/>).

Make sure you're not using a broker that had issues in January. Yes, the day after in Jan was the best time to transfer, but I personally wouldn't trust RH not to choose a nice sub-1k price to sell my shares at. Check the agreement - I've heard that they have a clause that lets them sell without your permission 'To protect' clients... Here's the reference you need: <https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/>

Consider printing out records and receipts. PDFs are good, but paper may be better. This is your proof you own shares on a given date in case of ultimate fuckery (not an excuse to stay with RH!).

FOUR. Time to level up your IT security game.

We follow the Red Queen!

Make sure you have 2FA or MFA enabled for your important accounts.

What's a VPN? It protects your IP (which tells people your general location) and encrypts your data so 'people' who may be trying to listen in can't see your info.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n38nw1/ysk_what_a_vpn_is_and_isnt/>

<https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/how-to-choose-a-vpn-for-digital-privacy-and-security/>

<https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vpn-services>

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndv72x/guard_your_identity_you_fools_how_to_prevent/>

Don't re-use Passwords. See this comic for good ideas: <https://xkcd.com/936/>

Make sure your browser (Chrome, Firefox etc.) is up to date. Chrome has had a number of 0d attacks in the past couple of months. Make sure your OS (e.g. Windows) is fully patched too.

FIVE. Power to the Players! Voting & Reporting is the filter for the HiveMind - whenever you upvote good content and downvote or report inappropriate material, you are making a difference and making this sub a better place!

SIX. Start researching likely Lawyers and Accountants you will use post squeeze. You want BIG firms who will have no idea who you are, other than their paycheck. Fee-based, not commission based.

Lawyers (Trusts and estates, wealth management, and tax law) and Accountants (of the tax or personal type) should not be local (unless you live in a capital city) - they should be used to dealing with the figures you will have.

This is a useful post with more info - US based, but a lot can be translated to other countries: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mutuhv/postmoass_an_indepth_examination_of_financial/>

SEVEN. Write a will, or at least start thinking about it. Also look into revocable living trust and charitable remainder trust. A will is cheap to create, but you get what you pay for. Make sure your documents follow your local rules about how they need to be prepared. You want to get it right the first time.

EIGHT. Figure out your likely tax rate and write it down.

NINE. Write down your exit strategy. Yes, I mean on paper. Psychology says writing things down helps you remember things. Maybe even make it like a contract with yourself to prevent paper handing. Consider selling SLOWLY, and I mean FUCKING SLOW. Don't Leroy this on us.

Here's two important DDs on a non-Reddit site that you could leave open in new tabs: <https://web.archive.org/web/20210309074023if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/> , <https://web.archive.org/web/20210319103103if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m0r4kg/gme_exit_strategy_here_is_what_i_not_we_i_am/>

<https://www.jumpstarttrading.com/trading-exit-strategies/>

TEN. Figure out which stocks you like less than GME, but would want to buy if the stock market happens to go onna fire sale when GME makes moon trip. Boring Boomer things good here. e.g. Vanguard Index Funds. Best bet is things that go down lots but still decent companies. Don't buy Apple if market is down 30% and Apple is down 1.3%. The FIRE guys at [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) are boring but have good advice. Other 'interesting' subs include [r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/), [r/fatfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatfire/) and [r/bogleheads](https://www.reddit.com/r/bogleheads/).

ELEVEN. Figure out how much you need to put aside to live on its interest. Here are some good resources:

<https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/>,

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhetrj/exit_strategy_planning_for_getting_passive_income/>,

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mefwc7/what_to_do_with_your_tendies_from_a_financial/>

TWELVE. Start writing down what you want to do after. e.g. Big # minus taxes, minus your new retirement fund, then figure out percentages for the remaining. How much to family? How much to charity? How much to cool stuff? How much to reinvest in GME?

THIRTEEN. Start thinking about what you want to do in the future. Like, 2 years in the future after you've finished partying. Typically, humans like to have a purpose. Do you want to start a biz? (Warning! Lotsa work! Recommend this book: <https://fixthisnext.com/>) Work for a Charity? Change politics?

FOURTEEN. Look into identity theft protection measures. Check out the content from Michael Bazzell - How To Dissapear Online and elsewhere. Do IRL peoples know your Reddit handle? Do you use your Reddit name elsewhere? Maybe it's time for a change. There's a reason this account was created in the end of Jan...

FIFTEEN. Clicking the 'Save' button right below will make this easier to find for future reference.

SIXTEEN. Figure out what self-care and mental prep works best for you (PMR works great! Used it before I knew what it was...) : <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrqgtg/an_apes_guide_to_selfcare_and_anxiety_management/>,

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr12dk/mf_moass_level_up/>,

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnfmrh/it_is_time_we_must_fully_prepare_ourselves_for/>,

Amazingly positive guru (exercises for any level of fitness): <https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/na7qfy/this_guy_talking_about_pushups_fitness_is_a/>

SEVENTEEN. Have a plan for reasonably forseeable events. What if a cell tower goes out? What if you lose power? Do you own a powerbank? Is it charged? Does your car have gas in case power in your city goes out and you need to travel to get internet? What if you need to reset your OS and lose a password manager? Do you remember your account logins?

EIGHTEEN. Read up on Shill tactics - this is serious money so of course they're spending to fight the squeeze:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mscsb5/putting_shills_on_blast_a_concerned_biznessman/>,

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1oc5u/shill_tactics_a_classification_based_on_infection/>

If shills are saying "You can't beat WallStreet at their own game - you're not smart enough", remember the long institutional holdings that are on the same side. People at BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard are also pretty smart and appear to hold around 23M shares.

Here is useful information about negotiation tactics to also keep in mind:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n12o03/are_you_prepared_for_the_biggest_negotiation_of/>

NINETEEN. Learn to Read (the Bloomberg Terminal)

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml9faf/how_to_read_the_bloomberg_terminal_by_smooth/>,

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml5dpc/financial_statistics_101_how_to_interpret_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

TWENTY. Pick out the colour of your new car (or bike for those in the Netherlands - ❤ from 🍁)

TWENTY-ONE. Eat properly (credit to [u/deleted](https://www.reddit.com/u/deleted/)...):

Exceptions for Ramadan foods granted.

During MOASS Launch

ONE. Remember Rule #1? Don't tell anyone you haven't already. Anoymity is your first and best defence. Consider the risk of quitting your job and buying shiny things. Abruptly quitting will cause people to ask questions. Best to ease into it (GME Mooning + "I'm outta here" = cover blown) or have a reasonable answer before you pull the trigger.

TWO. Monitor yourself for symptoms of medical shock. I'm not talking about vibrating from excitement here. These [include](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ConditionsAndTreatments/shock):

-   Pale, cold, clammy skin

-   Shallow, rapid breathing

-   Difficulty breathing

-   Anxiety

-   Rapid heartbeat

-   Heartbeat irregularities or palpitations

-   Thirst or a dry mouth

-   Low urine output or dark urine

-   Nausea

-   Vomiting

-   Dizziness

-   Light-headedness

-   Confusion and disorientation

-   Unconsciousness.

This can be fatal if it turns into a heart problem. Take it seriously. Be pro-active and call for help before it reaches unconsciousness.

THREE. Locate your exit strategy. Follow it.

FOUR. Practice the Self-Care that works for you.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

After Moon Landing

ONE. First rule also applies here. Keep a low profile. Remove social media posts that have your face in connection with owning GME. I will be removing the 'X' badge from my Tesla Model X for instance - this disguises it as a Model Y, which is around half the price.

Be on the lookout for extortion attempts, dating, desperate pleas for help, kidnapping, identity theft, friends with ulterior motives, invasion of privacy, etc. (People buy flight manifests to learn of high value targets <https://tim.blog/2020/02/02/reasons-to-not-become-famous/>)

Be careful of your postings of you are doing good deeds in your real name. You could get tracked if there is a report in a newspaper or something alike.

TWO. Celebrate, but in a restrained way. Fancy Dinner? Maybe you want to eat some 🎶[Kraft Dinner with that Fancy Dijon Ketchup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aynCgnbbgbM)🎶? (sorry I know you like Ramen better, couldn't resist)

THREE. Start contacting lawyers (boutique or firm with lawyers covering different areas), accountants, 'umbrella' insurance (particularly for you American Apes out there - don't lose your tendies because of a staged accident!)

FOUR. Is stock market onna fire sale? Maybe reinvest tendies on sale stocks! If you're moving tendies into your bank, be sure to call them first to advise them that the MOAD (Mother Of All Deposits) will be arriving in the next few days. The last thing you want is your assets frozen because the bank thinks something is suspect.

FIVE. Don't tell people until lawyer is onboarded and advising you for your unique situation. Also, always get second opinion when talking to lawyers, financial advisors, etc. These guys can smell new money from a mile away and will try to take advantage of you. If you are not married and headed towards a long-term relationship, ask your lawyer about a pre-nup.

SIX. Have accountant give you value after taxes and retirement fund. Start to work your plan.

SEVEN. Is medicaid a factor for you or a loved one? Look into Special Needs Trust. <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/special-needs-trust.asp>

EIGHT. Attend 1 year anniversary of the MOASS / bankruptcy filing of Shitadel. Wall Street likely too obvious and potentially a target. I am thinking Disney's Animal Kingdom best. Pretty sure they sell chicken tendies there. Wear a cryptic T-Shirt so we can do selfies together.

NINE. Be careful of drugs! Cocaine is glamorized in a ton of finance movies and is fun, but also harms your impulse control, is insanely addictive, and is expensive. Picking up a drug habit because you can afford one suddenly is a great way to lose your tendies.

TEN. Take care of yourself, your loved ones and go forth and make this world a better place! Don't forget to post about your good deeds here!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[u/Jamie-Vu](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jamie-Vu/) had a great point that I'm going to quote:

> But for those of us who want to use this money to change the world for the better, I think we need a big push to get organized in the aftermath, like a grand council of apes. Maybe combine it with the inevitable collosal meetup party we all talk about.We need to put together a think tank/foundation/lobbying group. A combined force that can hire scientists, researchers, experts in every field to help guide us through the process of fixing our world without fucking anything up despite our best intentions. It's a big ecosystem but our strength together is unquestionable when we focus all this energy in the same direction.

I completely agree. Apes together are going to make this world better!

I've had a brief discussion with someone who has Disney contacts, and they think Disney would be happy to be paid to host an annual MOASS event (in the evening; may not be feasible for the entire day - but you can pay $$$ to have an exclusive tour where they take you to the front of the lines...). I'm imagining that we could set up stalls with all the different charity ideas and have people from those charities that we could directly talk with and ask questions of. Apes could pitch their ideas for changes or new charaties to fellow Apes... I want to start planning this NOW, but I still have to get my day job done...

A Shameless Plug for Canada🍁

Canada has an investor class option for immigration! See [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa.html) for the "Start-up Visa Program".

Canada has generous supports for people who were/are unemployed due to COVID - we may argue, but in the end we want to take care of eachother and do the right thing.

Ottawa, Ontario is Canada's capital. It's a beautiful, safe and diverse city of 1M with a lot of cultural things to do with the museums and stuff. Solid education with a few universities/college in town on the rapid transit line. People here are also generally nice to eachother - almost like the fellow Apes in this sub. Having money also won't make you stick out. 😘

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Please point out what I am missing. I promise to read every main comment reply (e.g. the ones I get the notifications for) and edit the post to add the things I'm missing or refine what's above.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
