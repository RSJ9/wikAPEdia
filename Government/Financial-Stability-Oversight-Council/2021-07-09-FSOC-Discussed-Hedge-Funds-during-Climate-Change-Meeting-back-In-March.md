TL/DR Highlights: They know. They're working on it.

-   Hedge funds entered 2020 with higher than historical leverage.

-   Some very large funds have high leverage and are highly interconnected with financial markets and banks.

-   Some reductions in exposures to U.S. Treasury securities may have been due to hedge funds withdrawing from a specific bond basis trade.

-   Lenders to hedge funds face risks even if such lending is secured, because if a large fund, or many funds, suddenly failed, each counterparty may attempt to sell the collateral in unison, and the value of the collateral could decline materially, imposing losses on counterparties.

-   Large banks' exposures to hedge funds through lending and the significance of these exposures relative to bank assets.

-   Importance of the [SEC's Form PF.](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/pfrd/pfrdfaq.shtml)

-   Acting Chair of the SEC, provided additional information regarding Archegos, including further detail regarding the firm's investments and the SEC's coordination with other regulators

-   SEC staff's presentation was based on newly available data
