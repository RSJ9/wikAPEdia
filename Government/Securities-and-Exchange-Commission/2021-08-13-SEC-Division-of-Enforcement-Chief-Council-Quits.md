**On his last day with the Commission, we would like to thank Joe Brenner for his decade-long service to this agency as our Division of Enforcement's Chief Counsel.  Joe came to the SEC with many years of experience practicing securities law and wanted to put that expertise to work for the benefit of American investors and markets.  Under Joe's leadership, Enforcement's Office of Chief Counsel grew in expertise and responsibility and serves a critical role in advising the Director of Enforcement as well as the rest of the Enforcement staff on investigations and recommendations to the Commission.  Joe has always been a staunch supporter of his team, the Enforcement staff, and the agency's enforcement program.  We have truly appreciated Joe's extensive knowledge, his wise counsel, and his strong commitment to protecting investors and our markets.**
