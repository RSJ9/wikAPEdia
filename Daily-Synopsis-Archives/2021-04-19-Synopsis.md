Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Do you smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

None of this is financial advice, I just put the subs posts together so stuff doesn't get lost.

Big sell orders

Ok first things first as this one caught my eye, it seems some people (shills or people who are fairly new to this) have spotted a sell order of about 200,000 shares.

This won't be our boy DFV, and you know why I know?Because he likes the stock, he quadrupled down last friday, buying 50.000 from his options and 50.000 more at market price, meaning he upped his base price and spent a lot of money doing it.

He has stated a long time ago and multiple times through the months that he really just likes the stock and he sees GME doing a turn-around, netfix style (aka being a meh company to one of the biggest).

So going off of pure logic, why sell now ?

Late night Hedgies part 2; electric boogaloo

Ok so I'm away for the weekend come home and see we have mission impossible part deux monkey boogaloo going on.

so lets first give the sources

A good Ape did a great rundown in this threadÂ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtgr19/a_breakdown_of_citadels_overnight_activity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

So what the hell is going on?

Maybe a cleaning crew?

Well for ABN Amro I know for sure that it's most likely crypto as speculated before, as this came out todayÂ <https://www.businessinsider.nl/abn-amro-witwassen-schikking-480-miljoen-om/>

So does this mean that all the institutions and banks we have seen burning the midnight oil in the weekend where doing that? no.

ABN Amro did not themselves do money laundering but they had an obligation to check if clients where doing such things, and they didn't or failed in their efforts to do so.

This all seem to tie together with the crypto market crashing over the weekend, as well most institutional owners can't trade in the weekend because they're closed.

Also what's good to note is a comment made that I've read but could not verify if true, It seems that before the crash in 2008 the financial markets made the biggest moves on friday night saturday and sunday, but during the week it was business as usual, so we know what we need to look for this time around.

One word of note though, I am fully ok with keeping an eye out on institutions, but under no circumstances should anyone make personal contact with any employees, remember they are just people working for someone else, and we should respect the personal boundaries.

As for the pictures and videos, make sure you are following the rules and laws of your country, I know that in some countries it's legal in others it may not, so make sure you follow the law to the letter.

They may break the law on a daily basis, but we work in the light and uphold the law, always

The man with the plan

Our boy Gensler got sworn in on saturday!

<https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-65>

[as wrote in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtko2f/hypothesis_on_why_shitadel_is_working_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)Â it seems that there was an advanced notice that went out alongside it, it seems that the DTC-2021-003 may be implemented soon and there was a notice that went out to everyone that they needed to submit positions starting on Monday (or at least in the next week or so), tis could logically explain why a lot of banks were burning the midnight oil.

Also him being sworn in on a saturday is a big thing, as the only people from the SEC heads being sworn in on saturdays were always when shit hit the fan, so... yeah gives food for thought at minimum.

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-19-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/04c5x994q3u61.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c2a40296d49f2248d6b010ae7b4ec9e31c3fd7b)](https://preview.redd.it/04c5x994q3u61.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c2a40296d49f2248d6b010ae7b4ec9e31c3fd7b)

Also on the dog, let me be clear, it could be that this is a person with pure intentions and wants to help out, it could also be someone who's being propped up to look as a good person only to pivot later and change their tune, but as of right now it looks like it's a good boy.

So just as always, trust no one, double check everything and verify all info for yourself.

No dates!

Ok people let's go over this one again, no dates! we are excited for the coming weeks but as you can see, we've also seen a google search analytic that citadel is keeping a good eye out on this sub (<https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=US-IL-602&q=superstonk>)

We have been saying this for quite a bit

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-19-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/b95kpmojl3u61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc94dc3c4713a16753f8f377a2b77e6b5cde53d)](https://preview.redd.it/b95kpmojl3u61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc94dc3c4713a16753f8f377a2b77e6b5cde53d)

People have been saying they have been keeping their eyes on us for quite some time, so remember no dates, just chill and sit back and let it happen. and trust me I want this to be over ASAP, but we have to keep our heads on straight and realise these idiots will try to keep breaking moral as much as they can.

We have seen people from /biz/ come over here warning us of the same things happening to them, thread splitters, shills etcÂ [You can see the thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mscsb5/putting_shills_on_blast_a_concerned_biznessman/).

Things of note that you should definitely take a look at are these two links:

<https://preview.redd.it/8yz1vusxqlt61.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c2b96d2ae38e008e788b06f77508df45c795e93>

AndÂ <https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf>

Now I'm not in any way saying that there is a bigger organisation behind things, but we have been seeing exactly these things happen, so to be clear I'm not going full conspiracy on this, but these two links do describe who and what we have been seeing going on on multiple subs and even outside of that, we have been seeing the same on /biz/ reddit and even the comment sections of etoro and Webull.

So please read so you know what you are dealing with, as once the subjects (us) know what they are trying to do it won't work anymore.

Also everyone is hyped that even at this price DFV likes the stock, so you can expect Shitadel to try harder then ever to keep it down so be sure to keep an eye out for my favorite books, Fuckery, Advanced Fuckery and WHAT THE FUCKERY.

Yolo with Domo

yeah boiii, tomorrow we got our yolo specialists on, on 4/20.

So be sure to ask these guys everything you'd like, if you want to know who they are read their description, I personally like these guys as they seem to very straight forward and even go as far as calling shit out from the media (sherman got his shares called in and MSM wrongfully said he sold these), they talked with RC on how this stock could become 1000 a piece, and how it would go etc.

So be friendly be kind and ask them all the things you'd like to know.

DFV CONFIRMED! tinfoil hat time

Ok this award can be given by anyone, so even though it would be cool that DFV would be handing these out it's more likely that y'all are hyping yourself up and trolls and shills are abusing this to mess with you.

I mean for christ sake guys, anyone could give these out anonymously, so again TEMPER EXPECTATIONS.

I'd love for it to turn out that I'm wrong on this, but chances are much bigger that these awards come from regular people then DFV himself.

Looks decent but not sure

ok so I've seen this specific thread come up:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtftsq/i_think_i_figured_out_what_dfv_knows_and_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

It looks very promising but I'm gonna be 100% honest here, I have no clue if that's how it works or not.

If so then... fucking awesome, if not nothing bad and it's just another day.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.

If I missed anything I'm sorry but this weekend was more crazy then normal weekends, hell I'm an hour later with uploading then I normally post stuff... so wow
