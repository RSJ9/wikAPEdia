Good Morning San Diago,

The Exponential floor by¬†[u/jth1](https://www.reddit.com/u/jth1/), I'm excited to see how this model holds up in the next coming weeks and in what sense it will correct, seeing that gme is now officially been bellow it's fair value estimation for quite some time, this could be due to GME offering shares at the market, due to longs being bought for lower numbers (for example if the price is 10.00, and they buy for 9.99 then 9.98 creating a sale via a buy) or other methods.

Hedge fund that bet against GameStop shuts down

A London-based hedge fund that suffered losses betting against US retailer GameStop during the first meme stock rally in January is shutting its doors.

White Square Capital based in London is no more.

NSCC-2021-002 and NSCC-2021-801

According to their letter these will both be going into effect on wednesday

SEC Obtains Asset Freeze Against Offshore Fund

At this point it's unknown if this is in any way shape or form related to GME directly, however this is still very bullish to know they won't stop "because it's offshore" as it happened in the past, it seems that the SEC is slowly (very fucking slowly) turning into a "fuck around and find out" like it's big brother the IRS.

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-22-2021](https://preview.redd.it/0ln7x10xlr671.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=720902449ac69bf812c258d1792fe7e61e07be7e)](https://preview.redd.it/0ln7x10xlr671.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=720902449ac69bf812c258d1792fe7e61e07be7e)

It's good to see the SEC finally getting off their asses (or someone has finally installed a porn blocker on the servers) so they can finally get some shit done.

Body language of a small bulgarian boy

This next one is more a psychology thing, it's the body analysis of Vlad "the stock impaler",¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o51ajc/4_body_language_experts_analyze_one_of_vlad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o51ajc/4_body_language_experts_analyze_one_of_vlad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Now again this is not directly related to gme as hard numbers would be, but seeing he is involved in this saga it's still interesting to see.

Jefferies hosting a virtual conference,

thanks to¬†[u/arsvivendimk](https://www.reddit.com/u/arsvivendimk/)¬†for bringing this to our attention, Jeffries is going to host a conference focusing solely on digital gaming on June 24th!

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-22-2021](https://preview.redd.it/h92bb9csmr671.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cb8c315fd9ca00a3316a474a83bee566714a2da)](https://preview.redd.it/h92bb9csmr671.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cb8c315fd9ca00a3316a474a83bee566714a2da)

Seeing this is the company that issues the shares for gamestop it's something to at minimum keep an eye out for, as of right now I don't have a link for this conference but once I get one I will be updating this and adding it in.

Form 4 - Xu Yang - receiving 1,022 shares for the price of $0 (again seems to be payment, vested).

BNYMELLON seems to be changing before wednesday, my body is ready

thanks to¬†[u/SeniorSkrub](https://www.reddit.com/u/SeniorSkrub/)

Changing the name to omnibus is interesting. Seems related to derivatives trades, foreign markets, and tends to be looked poorly upon as they're used to hide identities of the investors behind them but apparently provide ability to act quickly in turbulent times.

Looks like Ellington involved here as well. They appear to be a hedge fund with a focus on mortgage back securities and mortgage derivatives. Interesting history with UBS and margin calls:

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
