Good Morning Superstonk!!

🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍

Does everyone have their permission slips for the AMA today? Did you remember to bring a banana and crayon sack lunch? We [vibing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzya83/me_n_the_boys_vibin_to_this_every_time_gme_spikes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)? Good! Let's get it!

3pm EDT

I've been going on all week about this AMA and talking about how excited the mod team is to be bringing you this level of relevant information on our ~~little~~ growing platform on reddit (and now YouTube). I've been telling you all about [Dr. T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Yv0ojfOl4) and getting you familiar with who she is and just how long she has been fighting the good fight, trying to expose naked short selling for what it is. It's admirable. It's legendary. And up until now, she has never met such a large group of apes, willing to learn and evolve to better understand this big, beautiful picture that is coming together.

But I also want to temper expectations.

There will be no planned questions about dO YoU tHiNk ThE sQuEEzE wIlL sQuOzE?! Dr. Trimbath is a professional and we respect her valuable time. She is doing this for us for free. And [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/) is a well trusted ape that is perfectly capable of representing this sub eloquently and succinctly. You've got this buddy. Good luck today 💪

Having said that, Dr. T has been reading up on some of the "God Tier" DDs such as those authored by [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/). So she is familiar with where ape is at on the evolution chart. Spoiler:not far. But she has not been in this rocket since January with us. She's not aware of some of the nuances that we have discovered with our peer reviewed DDs that we share here. And as much as she has read and seen while lurking, no one has the answers to everything.

We are capable of continuing to evolve as a community, and the interview with Dr. Trimbath today is proof of that. It's kinda like sitting at the big kids table for the first time, huh? **Tries desperately not to spill ketchup on the tablecloth**

[AMA](https://youtu.be/9rKS92zwh_o) starts today at 3pm EDT. Here's a [time zone converter](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) for my smooth brain babies.

Here's Brick Tamland aka [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/) with the Breaking News

🚨Breaking News- Proxy Documents Released🚨

BREAKING NEWS

I HAVE BREAKING NEWS!

... YELLING!!!!

Most of you know Gamestop released their Proxy Documents. This is a very hot topic and so a lot of people are linking it all over the place. We have received reports of attempts at getting users to click phishing links. We advise you to access the proxy documents and voting site, through OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY. That is to say, by one of the following methods:

-Through the GameStop Corporate website, accessible through a link on the bottom of [Gamestop.com](https://gamestop.com/)

-or-

-Through links provided by your broker

As many of you know there are lots of bad actors around right now, so it's best we are careful. Just like how we don't talk about positions, just an important precautionary measure.

When the proxy docs came out, I excitedly jumped for joy. Another opportunity to bring you apes more breaking news... yes, please! I immediately said to pink that I was going to dive in and deliver a full deep-dive report, I couldn't wait...

<https://imgur.com/a/v1K08uU>

So yeah, I may have jumped the gun.. 54 pages and then all the supporting research to see what is and isn't actually that relevant. So... instead of a fully fleshed out deep dive, for now, I bring to a broader overview of some of the highlights:

-Despite a pandemic year, GameStop only lost 9.5% of sales, which seems pretty bullish considering that all year they suffered closures across the USA and elsewhere.

-Perhaps it was because GameStop saw an increase of 191% in their Ecommerce sale! This due in large part to the huge improvements they made over the course of 2020

-The board Recommends voting for ALL nominees (That includes George Sherman)

How to vote:

Lot word

There is lots more info these pages, I am still working through them myself. I may do a deeper dive in the future if some wrinkle-brained ape doesn't get to it first. I encourage any and all apes to spend some time combing through the proxy docs, who knows what you'll find! Also, this is the company you are invested in, telling you about your investment, so it's worth reading the summary at least.

Back to you, [u/Pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pinkcatsonacid/)!

Annual Reports

Alright, I'm quoting [u/luridess](https://www.reddit.com/u/luridess/) on the annual reports because she is wrinkly and lovely and astute and I know you won't read it if I just link it:

Here's the TLDR 🦍 Translation of a Company's Annual Reports:

-   A company's "[Annual Reports](https://investor.gamestop.com/financial-information/annual-reports)" is just a fancy way of sharing their annual SEC 10-k filing with the public.

-   Information in an Annual Report includes:

    -   Letter to Shareholders (new)

    -   SEC 10-K filing (not new information - usually submitted at fiscal year end a month or so before)

    -   Fancy corporate information at the end of the report (new)

-   You can find all official corporate documentation on:

    -   [a company's website](https://investor.gamestop.com/financial-information/sec-filings) or

    -   [on the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001326380)

-   You DO NOT NEED to visit any proxy sites to obtain this information

-   DO NOT TRUST ANYONE - Only follow links to proxy sites that you find on:

    -   the official company website; or

    -   in documents filed on the SEC website

So please, stop hyping up Gamestop's 2020 Annual Report (regardless of when it's being released) or any legal document or corporate filing, before you actually read it and understand what it's about.

What you are doing is:

-   giving shills an opportunity to make similar posts using fake links for phishing/scam/fud purposes

-   setting yourselves up for disappointment - example: OMG ANNUAL FILING RELEASED MOASS CONFIRMED (when that is not actually the case)

-   setting yourselves up to be fooled/manipulated by actual shills who want to spread FUD - example: OMG ANNUAL FILING RELEASED BUT NO MOON I'M SELLING THIS IS FAKE YOU SHOULD SELL TOO

I know we are all excited and we want this thing to moon... but we have to be careful about the information we are posting and read things with a critical eye.

SEC Director of Enforcement Alex Oh, Former Wall Street Defense Attorney, Resigns

So [a statement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-sec-enforcement-director-alex-oh-resigns-agency-says-11619644474) by the new head of the SEC Gary Ginsler (who, by the way, hired Alex Oh as his first hire in his new position) is really all I want to focus on here. As [sus](https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/resignation-sec-s-new-enforcement-director-opportunity-break-sec-s-corrupting-practice) as this is, the main takeaway is the quote, "I thank Alex for her willingness to serve the country at this important time."

It was a very vague, broad statement to make on the matter. Though I wouldn't say much about a new employee that decided to show up for less than a week, get full access to everything currently being investigated, ~~randomly run a few paper shredders~~, then bounce, either.

But what the hell is this "important time" Mr. Ginsler is talking about? I understand there is still a pandemic and such, but what could the SEC deem so important right now? The market is strong, banks are showing better-than-expected quarterly earnings, just like they did in [2008](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos_theory_the_final_connection/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and... wait... oh no. Mr. Stonk, I don't feel so good....🤷‍♀️

A note from your friendly local pink cat 🐈

I haven't been able to interact as much in the comments, and I'm sorry for that!! I'm swimming in new responsibilities that I'm taking on with a ferocious appetite! I'm so proud of [u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/), [u/StonkU2](https://www.reddit.com/u/StonkU2/), [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/), [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/), and all the other mods that have been seriously working their tail ends off to bring you guys the evolution that is happening before your eyes within this sub. It's a labor of love that is starting to feel just a little bit like destiny. Remember when we migrated from WSB to GME? PinkCats remembers. Remember when we made the largest subreddit jump in reddit history and moved to our new home of [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/)? Look at what this community has created. We are broadcasting our peer reviewed findings on our very own YouTube channel today. To the world. And the world is watching (hello world!) because there is magic in this jungle. 🍌🍌🍌🍌🦄🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!
