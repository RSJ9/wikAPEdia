Ok let's do this thing!

First of all I would like to start with the petition again, be sure to sign and share this!We have passed the 16K mark at this point so lets keep going!

We have our very own USO show ladies and gentlemen, be sure to join this board or follow them on twitter

So first of lets start with the Twitter post from DFV.

There was some speculation to it and some sleep deprived redditors may have found some more info on this thing, great analysis which shows it's more then just a picture, as there was some serious editing of it.<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li0w9k/if_hes_still_in_im_in/><https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lhjpfa/retarded_theory_on_dfvs_cryptic_tweet_cause_i/>

Investigation of Market manipulation:

It's come to my attention through some posts, that the Feds and lawyers are currently investigating what's going on, this may not be the splash we have hoped for, but it's certainly a ripple in the waters in our favor.<https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/02/11/report-feds-investigating-meme-stock-frenzy-for-market-manipulation/?sh=3072f5ba2cb0>

And also the law firm of Hagens Berma, National Trial attorneys are setting up to help us but they need people who have GME to come forward, so if you have GME be sure to send them a message:<https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/29/2166829/0/en/HAGENS-BERMAN-NATIONAL-TRIAL-ATTORNEYS-Invites-GameStop-Corp-GME-AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc-AMC-and-BlackBerry-Ltd-BB-Investors-to-Contact-its-Attorneys-Firm-Investigating-Onli.html>

Short trades for GME no longer available through brokers:

In the past day I've seen some posts pop up about retail brokers no longer being able to get options on the stonks. This may come from a point of them wanting to protect themselves but it may as well be because the FED the SEC and Senate is breathing down their necks checking wtf is going on here.<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li639n/shorting_has_been_halted/><https://imgur.com/gallery/L2MUhXc><https://imgur.com/gallery/SRLl47i>

Even the Europeans can't short the stonks as seen in the comments of this thread:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li6tuk/fellow_europeans_what_happens_when_you_try_to/>So it's not just because the US brokers don't want to, this means it may be impossible worldwide because the well of shorts has dried up

Exit Strategies:

so the closer we come to the endgame the more important it is that we talk about an exit strategy.*(Relax I'm telling nobody to sell or how to do so**.)*The only thing I want everyone to know, don't panic sell when we reach 400+If we all sell at 400 then that will be the max we will get, so fade out, and sell bit by bit once we get to the top.remember they need close to 300% of the shares available to be able to cover (they really shot themselves in the foot by laddering).So remember 1K is a very real target, and as far as I've read the DD of other people between 5 to 10k is also very reasonable as long as we hold and don't sell, then the stock price will surge because DEMAND will exceed any kind of SUPPLY, remember we have so much stock between us right now that well.... WE ARE THE SUPPLY<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li0luq/gme_endgame_if_she_blows_smart_ape_will_sell/><https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

GameStop Board Holding and didn't sell a single share when it was 400+<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li35oi/gme_ryan_cohen_dd_stillholding_diamondhands/><https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lhncjx/looks_like_gmeexecs_held_the_line/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

Some DD I found interesting:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li4sgp/the_most_important_diamond_update/>

Remember this is the same member that YOLO'd about 100K into stocks yesterday, so this man put his money where his mouth is.And I think you don't get that amount of cash to yolo ( and then be able to sit back and Diamondhand this bitch) if you didn't know what you where doing.

**Remember me talking about using psychology as a weapon a few days ago?**Welp looks like Melvin and Karen are doing just that:<https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/sentiment-trader-at-quant-hedge-fund-at-cindicator-2410397759/>

**Support:**So after Musk, O'Leary and Cuban, we can add Chamath to this list as well.Remember the mainstream media (wsj, CNBC cnn etc) have spoken out against us and even got a Billionaire to cry on tv (billionaire loss porn is the best porn).So the fact that we have people who are respected on our side is very important, this is because a lot of people look up to them and this will change public opinion about this in our favor.(and yes that opinion is important, why else would every HF try to use the media against us?)

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li01jm/is_chamath_talking_about_us_redditors_doing_our/>

And last but not least,STFU ABOUT WHEN THE SHORT SQUEEZE WILL STARTThe more we put a date on it the worst it will be. why?Because if you keep hearing it will happen on monday, and then by friday it hasn't happened you can feel bad and doubt yourself about this.The more Melvin reads " oh they expect monday? fuck it lets lengthen this battle a week"This is to break morale.So sit back, eat some crayons and just wait and see.There is no clock for us, but there is for them.

again like always, if I've missed anything important let me know I'll add it to the list
