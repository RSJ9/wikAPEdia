Goodmorning everyone,

I am Rensole, and welcome to the morning news

*insert flashy intro card*

This is going to be a longer one lads, as I'm going through a lot of the hearing papers.

TL:DR I'm very bullish right now

The hearing:

The hearing will take place on Today, February 18th at 12:00pm E.T

This is 18:00 Central European time (Brussels).

[You can watch it here](https://financialservices.house.gov/live/)

Ok so we have a hearing, now what?

Well one of the things I would recommend at this point is emailing your representative

[Like this thread describes](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/llm89h/pls_email_your_reps_template_for_congress_inside/)

Some people have said in the past that the government wont do anything for them, but they can't afford to NOT do anything now. Due to the fact that the GME situation is bigger then just USA, it has millions of investors from all across the globe they are forced to intervene. Otherwise they may force a crash, as if the world stage would no longer have faith in the USA's system they can pull out, resulting in a firesale.

They have to do something now, and the worlds eyes are on them and they know it. That's why Sen Waters has spoken out in a letter, as did AOC.

-DFV, ceasar-king of apes, Keith Gill;

A lot of people where speculating as him being a former employee for Melvin, this isn't true he used to work in the marketing sector of MassMutual and had nothing to do with buying stocks, or advising people on what to buy.His youtube channel is also just to project his thesis, and wasn't meant to get anyone to buy into this with him (like fucking duh?)He made his thesis made on publicly available information, just like all the DD we all have done here.and most importantly, his ending quote:

> GameStop's stock price may have gotten a bit ahead of itself last month, but I'm as bullish as I've ever been on a potential turnaround. In short, I like the stock. And what's stunning is that, as far as I can tell, the market remains oblivious to GameStop's unique opportunity within the gaming industry.

He didn't say it was a squeeze or anything of those sorts, no he said it has gotten AHEAD of itself.Meaning he sees this company get to this point in a more natural way, as he does see gamestop reinvent itself and be one of the biggest players.

"In short, I like the stock -Keith "DFV" Gill"

Vladimir "Vlad the stock impaler" Tenev

As far as I can read this guy has nothing new to add, he's trying to shift the blame from them halting trading had nothing to do with them.Saying it's all due to how his company is structured and how the payments work.But he doesn't mention that why they halted trading altogether, and how the Market Makers he works with/for actually benefitted from this.He says they couldn't buy due to the increased funds they needed to pay, which they didn't have.But he did have 2 billion to pay for a superbowl add that same week.He also didn't state why people could not sell out of their positions.

or why people could only buy 1 share then 5 then 10 etc.

Gabriel "Melvin" Plotkin

His statement is made to elicit an emotional response.If you read through it, it kicks off with"I went to public schooling, didn't have a job when I got out, now I'm a family guy, so much so I named Melvin capital after my grandfather, please like me"

He also went on to slander our reddit subs by saying:" In January 2021, a group on Reddit began to make posts about Melvin's specific investments. They took information contained in Melvin's SEC filings and encouraged others to trade in the opposite direction. Many of these posts were laced with antisemitic slurs directed at me and others. The posts said things like "it's very clear we need a second holocaust, the jews can't keep getting away with this." Others sent similarly profane and racist text messages to me. "

Don't know about everyone here but.... I've not seen anything on here that even comes close to that, and I don't think if it where to be posted here that it would be tolerated in the slightest.Also... who the fuck got his Personal number? If that would've been found I think that would've been posted publicly as well but have not seen anything of the sort.

He also said the following:"When this frenzy began, Melvin started closing out its position in GameStop at a loss, not because our investment thesis had changed but because something unprecedented was happening. "

but then how come the numbers don't back that statement up?why you lying Melvin

Ken "citadel" Griffin

To be honest this guy had nothing to add to the conversation IMO.Just stating that we should change the market as it is now

" Recent events have highlighted clear opportunities to improve our markets. One takeaway is the importance of modernizing the settlement process, including shortened settlement cycles and transparent capital models. As we have seen, longer settlement periods expose firms to more risk in the time between execution and settlement, requiring higher levels of capital. Settlement cycles should be shortened from T+2 to T+1. Transparent clearing house capital requirements will enable brokers and market makers to better prepare for potential capital demands and minimize the risk of associated market interruptions. Both of these enhancements are well within reach today. "

to summise:

DFV: I like the stockVlad: I shift the blameMelvin: PLZ like me, closed positions but the numbers dont support this (taking XRT into account)Citadel: why am I here?

Also I personally expect to hear from the GameStop Board very soon.Nothing to back this up except for a gut feeling.

Also people need to remember that the guys like Melvin,citadel and RH have a lot to lose.Remember the ending of the big short?that's what this is like<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpCb3xjh-Kk&ab_channel=Extractor>

Remember these guys have a lot to lose, if someone will look into them and see the illegal practices their companies have been undertaking in the past months (that we know of) they are fucked.So expect them to lie, as they always have and always will.Because none of these idiots will ever just come out of the woodwork and say, "yeah I did some illegal shit to cover my ass why?" won't happen, they'll lie and fight every step of the way.

In conclusion a few things,1- I love how bullish the board has become once more, it seems we are seeing less trolls/shills in the past 2 days, let's hope this continues going forward ðŸ˜‰

2- If the stock price shoots up while the hearing is in progress, Melvin Citadel and the others wont be able to do anything as you are not allowed to use your phone when in a hearing

3- I will be getting more shares during the hearing, and heard that a lot of other people post the same thing and I love it. (I'm in now way saying that you should do this just saying what I am going to do, not financial advice.

4- Don't expect the squeeze to happen right off the batt and go from 0 to a 100 in an hour, it took weeks originally to get where it got, and it will take a bit of time before it starts shooting up.

5- Don't set dates for the squeeze, it happens when it happens.

6- For today I'm feeling jacked! JACKED TO THE TITS!

I've been in this sub since wsb went tit's up and I'm loving the community, the positivity and the sharing of all information, and I love all of you beautiful apes!

Again as always, none of this is financial advice, and if you feel like I've missed something feel free to post and let me know, I'll include all relevant information !
