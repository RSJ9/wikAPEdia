Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

Let's start with the basics once more!

VOTE!

Be sure to vote with your shares, don't think it won't matter because it does, over-voting would show there are lots of things being wrong and would give the company a much needed excuse to call their votes back in.

Also for the 6/9 (nice) annual shareholders meeting, remember that we will most likely not see a lot happen to the stock immediately after this because if they have something planned (NFT/Dividend/ recounting their own shares etc) it can be mentioned there but could still take some time before it can be implemented.

Like the NFT is set to launch around the 14th, if they were to give a dividend it could also be a few weeks, a recount can take a lot longer though, due to the audit process being very specific it may take a month or maybe longer (I can't say, or imagine, how long auditing the shares would take as this is a scale because the situation unprecedented) and there is a chance the vote count can be doctored to make sure it shows a non accurate vote count, regardless of everything just hodl and wait, as news reports have already stated SHF have list close to 2 billion usd just from Monday till Wednesday, but also these are "paper" losses as there is only an actual loss once they close their positions.

Congrats on the upgrades!

First of all I'd like to start with giving a shout out to two fellow mods,¬†[u/bye_triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/bye_triangle/)¬†and¬†[u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/), as has become normal for us, in the beginning moderators get limited powers (just so we know they're doing a good job etc etc), well both¬†[u/bye_triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/bye_triangle/)¬†and¬†[u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/)¬†have gone above and beyond on many occasion and are as of right now full moderators.

[u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/)¬†had already made a post announcing this but I just wanted to give these awesome apes a shout out myself and congratulate them <3

Having a friend at a HF is so hot right now....

Gamestop stopped geoblocking their website

As some people over the past week have noticed GameStop has opened up their websites accessibility to worldwide instead of usa only, this is very bullish imo. This because if you look at websites like Amazon they have the same website available everywhere, and the products available change, meaning there is a fairly decent chance we can see a worldwide shift in how they do business.

Gamestop used to be very different from how their German/Australian/Usa/Canadian stores did business, among which there were different names (GameStop, Ebgames, Gamestopzing, etc) so there is a shot they will be looking into unifying these (given the international recognition the brand now has it would be smart), then adding fulfillment centers outperforming Amazon in delivery time, this is a lot but it all starts with a simple website being accessible to everyone.

DTC-2021-005

I just want to remind everyone that this document has been missing for a few months now, it was "offline te be reformatted" due to a "formatting issue", but Gary Gensler has only been working for 7 weeks...

Not a lot of comments here, just making sure (just like other apes on the sub) that this important document doesn't fade into obscurity).

Fud

A clever ape did a writeup of all the FUD we have already seen and overcome, it's nice to look back because the only way to make sure we don't repeat history is to study it.

All apes this long weekend

Etoro

Now this is the juicy bit, we've seen a lot of speculation on this one, we have seen people extrapolate information from the statement that Etoro has 1.5% of GME holders, then we've seen people think that this means that we have a couple of options

1.  gme has 89 million sharews

2.  gme has over 1000 million shares

3.  etoro is stating amount of users that they have they have 1.5% (meaning 98.5% of their users dont have gme)

4.  something else entirely

Now we can't answer for sure what this means, I'll be looking into it today and reading peoples DD on this and see if I can form a wrinkle, after that I'll be contacting the CEO from Etoro (full transparency like always: due to some weird happenstance a twitter user put us in contact and we had a brief interaction, hopefully due to having this line of communication open I can ask him a question about this, but again there is no security that he will even answer, nor does he have to as I'm still just a regular ape and not some bigshot), and for the people saying "why the hell would he talk to you?"... dude I've been wondering the same thing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Again take these numbers with a grain of salt and a bucket of "inconclusive"

For (R)/Cohan!

Citadel is filing form D's

A smarter ape has written a piece about the recent filings of Citadel, namely their form D amendments, and what they mean and what it could imply, give it a read¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np6f78/citadel_has_been_filing_form_d_amendments_and_ill/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I wont give a synopsis of this because it's fairly short and well and easily understandable.

Parting thoughts

Now before I go slip back into my cave for the day I do have some thoughts that wont fit in the news stories naturally so I'd rather do it here separate from the rest.

First of all guys chill the fuck out, there are trolls, shills etc, these people are doing what they're doing for one thing only, to get you to respond on an emotional level, don't get lured out and just relax, remember who benefits from shaking["The jar of ants"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nn5xnf/the_jar_of_ants/)?

There is no sense of urgency to speculate on Etoro or other traders total amount of shares, this has become a game of patience, if Etoro/degiro/yomama has 10% of the float or a 100%, I believe at this point we've found out that we at least own the float (AT MINIMUM) atleast once, meaning... it doesn't matter how many shares there are (even though it would be cool to know) again, the mantra of "Buy-Hold-vote-zen" applies, be zen, be chill just wait.

The shareholders meeting, I've seen a lot of people talking in a way that everything will pop off at the meeting itself, don't hype yourself up to much my friend, even though I would love to have this pop off then I believe that the day of the annual sharehodlers meeting may be a sideways day. Again No dates, so only Jaques your tits to about 60%, no full Jaquesing (even if I personally hope it will pop off at the same day, lets remain realistic ;) )

And as always, Expect fuckery

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-01-2021](https://preview.redd.it/7vwl7b8yjm271.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=f992f4f07dd3eec3b404596ba1f736fca2eeba48)](https://preview.redd.it/7vwl7b8yjm271.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=f992f4f07dd3eec3b404596ba1f736fca2eeba48)

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
