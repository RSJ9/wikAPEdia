Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

The Reverse repo's

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-17-2021](https://preview.redd.it/hs0r0frahs571.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=637524d1bb099bf73872a755f7acecaeaea98ed7)](https://preview.redd.it/hs0r0frahs571.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=637524d1bb099bf73872a755f7acecaeaea98ed7)

The reverse repo seems to be up once more, to 520 billion, with 53 parties involved.

Jpow also told us yesterday there was "totally nothing to worry about" but more on that later.

Also a list of participants has been found here:¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1rzgw/rrp_list/h22g31h/?context=3>

The exponential floor, the price seems to be marching sideways for the past three days, this can indicate a lot of things, I would advise checking out¬†[u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/)'s thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1fbhw/0616_update_floor_guys_log_stonkdate_259_pretty/)¬†for more information.

Some people have indicated this may be like the "death of a thousand papercuts" dd we've seen here.

There also seems to be some indescrepencies with the open/closing prices in the market for the past few months. I've been in chatrooms were we talked about the fact that it's ending on 00 or 0010 is a statistical outlier, because it happened way to often it was weird for us because if you looked across the board most stocks would end in random numbers, and not on a nice round 0010.

[u/LongTimeGamer](https://www.reddit.com/u/LongTimeGamer/)¬†did a solid DD¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1gn2u/i_processed_16_years_of_data_across_8_stocks_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)¬†were they analysed the past 16 years of 8 stocks to show that the closing price of these is a weird happening as this isn't normal, be sure to check out his thread.

To 005 or Not to 005, that is the question

There also have been some questions since yesterday if the 005 was in effect or not.

The short answer is, Yes it is.

check out¬†[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1fywn/me_again_according_to_john_at_the_dtcc_005_is_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)¬†which shows correspondence between¬†[u/OkGas9917](https://www.reddit.com/u/OkGas9917/)¬†and the DTCC, and they themselves state that it's in effect .

Bitcoin address

I got tagged in¬†[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1fi1v/sent_this_today_to_someone_and_we_closed_green/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)¬†yesterday, but I honestly don't know enough about crypto give any help here, so if there are apes here who are good with that sort of stuff be sure to jump in and try to give them a hand.

It seems that there is a wallet address that has some correlation with the price movements of GME, but again I know jack about crypto.

Remember Kenny, you always have options

[u/Veschor](https://www.reddit.com/u/Veschor/)¬†had scraped some data off of fintel.io data for all filings under 3/31, crosswalk it against SECs EDGAR db for data quality. be sure to check out¬†[his thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/o1fqxi/gme_options_data_dashboard_for_reporting_period/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), I'm not entirely sure what this means but I believe they may have doubled all the shares outstanding by the looks of it... or I'm reading this wrong.

But it seems that kenny and others need about 51 million shares in order to cover, which... they can't lol.

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-17-2021](https://preview.redd.it/q63d32gels571.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=604d237824bcf97a956d2fb794eaa8af430f531a)](https://preview.redd.it/q63d32gels571.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=604d237824bcf97a956d2fb794eaa8af430f531a)

The FED

Jpow held a press conference yesterday which boiled down to the following points:

-   we are in unprecedented times

-   due to that we can't make any plans or projections

-   But inflation shouldn't be that bad¬†ACCORDING TO OUR PROJECTIONS

-   Jpow gets a questions, then bullshits around the subject for a few minutes and moves on

So what really got me annoyed with this yesterday were a couple of things

Mainly the fact that he says you can't have a model or a projection for the coming times but moments later refer to their own model and projection saying "it wont be that bad"... so which one is it Jpow? you can either have a model or not.

Also the inflation is now projected at 3.4% instead of 2, but it's "transitionary" ... this is like seeing my cousin vinny answering tough questions "forget about it"

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-17-2021](https://preview.redd.it/rc777zqzms571.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=08e0196e9bf6241791dfb24b3af24e7cceb56f74)](https://preview.redd.it/rc777zqzms571.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=08e0196e9bf6241791dfb24b3af24e7cceb56f74)

For those unaware the phrase "whistling past the graveyard" means acting tough while being scared on the inside, which I'm sure they are, even from a non stock perspective it seems like they screwed the pooch and are now realising that maybe printing 40% of all the money may have been a bad idea.

As some of you who have been reading my shitty writing for a while may know I love the art of war, because it gives simple yet effective rules of psychological war.

There was a thread made here¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o19ak7/the_bigger_short_srdtc2021005_the_return_of_dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

And it gives some explenations how the art of war may be implemented right here, so... unleash your own Gordon Gecko and give it a read.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Also hmmm

"In some of the meme stocks that we've seen, or stocks that have a high level of retail participation, the vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic," said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange Inc's¬†[(ICE.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ICE.N)¬†NYSE.

"That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is," she said at a conference hosted by CNBC.
