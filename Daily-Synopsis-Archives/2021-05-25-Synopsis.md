Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

Shoutout to¬†[u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/)

So the AMA yesterday had some technical difficulties, which in and of themselves suck to have. But I have to say I'm extremely proud of how my fellow mod handled the situation, as far as I know Pink had not done an AMA before but if you told me she did I would have believed you.

She handled it with grace and once Lucy couldn't reconnect she acted fast and well, stepping up and going on with the show like a true champ.

Seriously, kudo's for your work Pink üëèüëèüëè

RC Tweet

Steve floats to the top?

<https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1397047791889879041?s=20>

I know this is from "American Dad" and the kids name is Steve, he seems to be floating up.

Can be a shitpost or can be a message that has something to do with the float.

What's funny to know about this scene is (from memory) steve was a terrible swimmer and had Claus stuck in his swimming shorts to do the work, so could also be a reference to someone working behind the scenes?

Again could be a lot could be nothing.

Addendum:¬†[u/ChemicalFist](https://www.reddit.com/u/ChemicalFist/)¬†found out something interesting, there is an investing term called "underwater"

hmmmmmm interesting!

When in doubt, zoom out

It's been on a two week rise, even if the "daily" profit was gone by a flash, look at the chart it's still ok.

Slow and steady my friends, slow and steady.

We've been saying this for a long long time, the Moass is like Gandalf, it will come when it is meant to, just hodl, chill out and see what happens.

This was never meant for a quick buck, or whatever, re-view Deepfuckingvalue's videos where he talks about diamond handing, look at Mark Cuban's ama on wsb.

This was never going to be easy or fast, so sit your monkey ass back, share a banana with a friend and have some laughs. Because we are still waiting on the annual shareholders meeting.

If after the shareholders meeting they see that there is an extremely high amount over votinging they won't take action that exact day, they'll go through their legal channels and it may be a few weeks before we hear about it (trust me they want/need to do everything above board) this is because they can file lawsuits against the bad actors and get "damages" paid.

But that's all speculation, all I'm trying to say is learn to be zen, it will come when it comes.

Crypto SUUUUUUUUUBS

Ok guys real talk here for a sec, we have had some cryptobro's along our side for quite some time now, people actively posted on my thread yesterday saying they were here from jan/feb ish but never posted, so this is awesome to have more people aware of all of this.

The one thing that isn't cool however, is going on THEIR subs and saying they should get into GME/AMC/ANYTHING

Imagine how you would react if someone came in here trying to push Bitcoin/Etherium/Dogecoin ? You'd get upset right? so please understand that if they want to post about GME they'll come here, but we should in no way brigade their subs

Italian bank collapses on exposure to Greensill and GFG

there is a thread about it right¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nk3ddb/italian_bank_collapses_on_exposure_to_greensill/gzamro3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Be sure to give it a read ;)

Sen Elizabeth Waren: wants to bar congress from trading individual stocks

<https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-ban-congress-trading-stocks-investing-tom-malinowski-nhofe-2021-5?international=true&r=US&IR=T>

TL:DR Congress abuses their knowledge of stocks (like with the covid crash) and profits and outperforms the market, if this moves forward they wont be able to do that anymore.

Nice to see some people actually making waves.

Bitcoin wallet ?

According to¬†[THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkde38/bitcoin_address_activity_appear_to_mirror_gme/)¬†post, there seems to be a bitcoin wallet moving at against GME, now I'm not wrinkle brained enough to understand this, but I hope I can bring this to the attention of smarter apes here who could be willing to help and research this OP, and maybe find some more stuff out.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

And yes this is not being posted through Automod, Automod does not let me edit my posts after they have been posted (I'm currently looking into it if it's at all possible to do, because if new news comes out during the day it is important to add in here, then I want to add it in, instead of making 30 posts a day).If someone smart could perhaps help me with the automod posting and editing of posting please let me know in a comment!
