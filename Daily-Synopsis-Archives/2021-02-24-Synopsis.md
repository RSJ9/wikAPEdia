Good morning everyone,

I am Rensole,

You're watching Channel 4 News with five-time Emmy award-winning anchor Ron Burgundy and Tits McGee

*insert flashy intro card*

CFO CFBYE

Yesterday GameStop announced that Jim Bell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will be resigning from his roles on March 26, 2021. And they're looking to replace him from either inside hire or outside hire, if no one will be found on the outside they're most likely to hire Diana Jajeh, who is currently Senior Vice President .

So I've seen some people post "THIS IS BAD" nah I see this as an absolute win.This person is one of the few on the board that I had some serious doubts about (along with the Autoparts CEO as he's to oldschool to be of help).

some info on why this may be good can be found here :

<https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqvg5q/dd_is_always_in_the_comments_why_cfo_jim_bells/>

The reason why this is also good is because due to a new CFO, shares can be recalled and counted.The most likely reason he has been let go of his current position is that he's just sitting on his ass and did nothing in the gamestop stock mania, meaning that appointing a new CFO will trigger a recall and recalculation of stocks, investigate wtf has been going on, actually do something about the madness that is the MM.Remember, Melvin and Citadel tried to kill this company and he didn't do anything, so lets just hope the new CFO will do a better job.

also to give you some idea on how bad he fucked up is summarized by Domo capital:

Jim Cramer

So Cramer is going rant over rant on GME because he doesn't like it, just love how he got portrayed in Iron Man is no longer a gimmick but his actual persona.He's been going off on Twitter, why GME is removed from fundamentals, how it's just "Dumb money" and the people don't know shit.

Now Cramer has been put in his place a bit by Domo Captial.

Domo Capital by their own words on their website:

```
DOMO Capital Management, LLC, founded in 2007 by Justin Dopierala and headquartered in Germantown, Wisconsin, is a Wisconsin Registered Investment Advisor.

As of January 31, 2021 DOMO managed $27.896 million in assets.

DOMO firmly believes that a concentrated portfolio, chosen via a repeatable discipline emphasizing undervalued and out of favor stocks with solid fundamentals, leads to superior risk adjusted returns over the long-term. Fundamental to success with this approach is an investors patience and long term orientation, as return patterns are often out of sync with broader market patterns.

We are also concerned about return of capital, and might use a larger cash position and other techniques when overall market conditions appear troublesome.

So by the looks of who they are, and they're going against the narrative along with their mission statement I think it's safe to say, we have this whale on our side.And I just love how my personal assessment of over a 100 usd per share is the norm is kindof confirmed here, I love confirmation bias in the morning <3

Paperhands Portnoy "interviewed" Vlad.

I have to be honest, normally I try to read and watch everything related to this to have a well formed opinion, but I couldn't muster the basic interest to watch Vlad in cuck training again.it's 40 minutes and I'm sure he appreciates every question and is glad to address it here.

if someone wants to give me a TLDR I'll put it here, and I'll be appreciating and thankful for that.

Finra data is skewed?

Finra report is due today so expect that, also expect the shorts to be spread across multiple ETF's

[u/ThrowMoneyAway38](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowMoneyAway38/) posted this 6 days ago but I've only just found it, thanks buddy!

his own TLDR:

Fintel has been using numbers for total volume covering many exchanges, but only reports short volume from a subset of those exchanges, which makes short % look smaller. In the past two weeks, there there were very few (if any) shares on the market that weren't short. That being said, shorters maybe able to juggle for a while.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lm7840/what_can_we_expect_from_the_feb_17_short_interest/>

So this means what?

It means it gave me a huge confirmation bias boner, we have been saying that the Finra models may look off, as in they're there but... everyone seemed to come up with another number.

So what to expect? well that one is easy, they have to report the numbers by the law right? BUT it's not how they report it that's the problem its WHERE they do.

And I can hear you say "but Rensole, you're so retarded for even saying that" and you're right, but not because of this, just in general.

When we found out by XRT I said to people check it out if this is possible in other ETF's, and we are right. the amazingly wrinkle brained [u/ResponsibleGunOwners](https://www.reddit.com/user/ResponsibleGunOwners/) found loads of ETF's with GME

I'm not going to summarize it as you should read it in it's entirety

Also this guy bought shares... that's all.

Volumes

So if you remember correctly I posted about volumes yesterday, and saying how lower volume would benefit us (Tldr the less volume they have to fuck around with the less space they have to do fuckery).

and guess what, yesterday's volume is even lower at only 36% of the day before.

Melvin and Griffin might have missed the note that size does matter.

Does that mean the squeeze is here? no it means we are moving steadily towards it.

Also once this is over we wont have squeezed Melvin and Citadel, this is more an autoerotic chokehold we'll have them in... don't kink shame me Sharon.

SSR for 2-24-2021

will be on the list today 2-24 will get off of it on 2-25

The most important take away from this all is simple.Inadequate CFO got fired, melvin is backed into a hole, and things are looking good. we are fueling our nice little rocket for all the retards, and most importantly Melvin and citadel are kind enough they keep adding and make the moon nice and big for us

We are a generation of Gamers, we have spent hours, days hell WEEKS grinding just so we can get a cosmetic item (or achievement trophy) just to show us that we did it.Now we are grinding for tendies, and all we have to do is simple, Buy hold repeat.Their volume and liquidity is dying down so we wait, just like the boss battles, wait till the weakpoint is open and we strike, retreat and repeat.

Take it slow, take it easy but most importantly, Stay classy San Diego.

As always this is not financial advice I eat crayon soup 3 times a day.As always if you feel like I missed something feel free to mention it and I'll include it right here and I'll add it in!

Edit 1: for a brief second I saw this happen on Nasdaq, was lucky enough to screenshot it

Might be a glitch, but I've never seen it jump so high without any reason to only go back to 44.32 usd. Anyone else seen this?

Edit 2: not a glitch
