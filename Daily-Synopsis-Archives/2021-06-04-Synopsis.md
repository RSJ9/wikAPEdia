Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

Be sure to vote with your shares, don't think it won't matter because it does, over-voting would show there are lots of things being wrong and would give the company a much needed excuse to call their votes back in.

Also for the 6/9 (nice) annual shareholders meeting, remember that we will most likely not see a lot happen to the stock immediately after this because if they have something planned (NFT/Dividend/ recounting their own shares etc) it can be mentioned there but could still take some time before it can be implemented.

Like the NFT is set to launch around the 14th of July, if they were to give a dividend it could also be a few weeks, a recount can take a lot longer though, due to the audit process being very specific it may take a month or maybe longer (I can't say, or imagine, how long auditing the shares would take as this is a scale because the situation unprecedented) and there is a chance the vote count can be doctored to make sure it shows a non accurate vote count, regardless of everything just hodl and wait, as news reports have already stated SHF have list close to 2 billion usd just from Monday till Wednesday, but also these are "paper" losses as there is only an actual loss once they close their positions.

Please go out and vote! there are only a few days left that you can, I believe the official cut off date is the 6th.

Reverse Repo

And it's back up ladies and gentlemen, as of 6/3/2021 it has increased back to $479B with only 40 counterparties. This nearly matches the all-time-high with 13 less members meaning they'll soon be hitting that sweet 80 billion limit, after that... no clue what will happen.

*plays it's always sunny in Philadelphia theme*

Morning Sunshine

It seems that the SEC meeting of the sunshine act finally went through, this meeting was cancelled about 5 or 6 times in the past months, but it's only Gary's 7th week, he can't be expected how to do meetings so fast.

Also this one is still missing

When someone gives you a Jeffrey

Ok seems someone found something big yesterday¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrgdlo/this_is_huge_news_investment_banking_company/>

The tldr is Investment banking Company Jeffries suspends short sells on GME AMC and MVIS

Jeffries is a prime broker, and is used by GME for their Share offerings, so they are not the biggest player, but big imo nonetheless.

His thread has a bit more details so if you'd like to know more I'd advise checking that out ;)

Now onto something a bit more speculative

TWEETS!

Going to be honest seeing¬†[u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/)¬†shitpost memes again, I just love it but lets focus on our boy RC first,

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-04-2021](https://preview.redd.it/sfrfkr3kp7371.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=feb60a05885200a78fda27f32a56a1ec7d0897af)](https://preview.redd.it/sfrfkr3kp7371.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=feb60a05885200a78fda27f32a56a1ec7d0897af)

I personally think that R.I.P. Dumb ass is litteral, there is no hidden meaning here other then he's finished the backroom stuff and is now just gloating, the dumb ass who tried to fuck GME over are now on the brink of collapse themselves.

Now the Sears being demolished is a tricky one as there are a lot of different options as to what it can pertain to.

it could be a link to the SEC's ARS

credit to u/piefke_

it could be how Sears had it's downfall in 2018¬†<https://www.investopedia.com/news/downfall-of-sears/>

or it could be a cheeky reference with the "Rip Dumb ass" tweet that this is slowly happening to the SHF

Now onto some exciting news

4 Trading days left

There are only 4 trading days left until the annual shareholder meeting. Again I'd say expect fuckery as always, expect them trying to tank the price, expect idiots spreading FUD expect everything.

But I'm still bullish for the Annual shareholders meeting, Again I personally don't expect them to know the full amount of naked shares out there by then, but I do expect some sort of message saying they're officially going to look into it, I'm expecting a roadmap of the future of the company, I expect some AWESOME Q1 numbers (with the hype that's been on GME since early jan, the amount of consoles bought of the new cycle, nintendo switches donated to childrens hospitals, apes saying "nah not going to amazon I'll get it from GME", all that combined will make for some killer announcements and earnings.

I'm Jaqued because of this alone.

But do keep in mind, if you were on the other side, you'd try to stretch the inevitable until you couldn't anymore and it just blows up, so don't expect anything to happen on the day itself, as I've seen here on the sub many a times

"it can be the best day ever, or it can be just another ordinary day"

so.. be Jaqued, but only to about 60%, we can party once this is over üòâ

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
