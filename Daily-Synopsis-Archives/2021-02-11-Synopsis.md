Synopsis for 02-11-2021 What we need to know before market opens
================================================================

Ok let's go people lets do this thing!

First of all I would like to start with the petition again, be sure to sign and share this!Almost at 15khttp://chng.it/4vr66xKkc9

We have our very own USO show ladies and gentlemen, be sure to join this board or follow them on twitter<https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondTitties/><https://twitter.com/Diamond_Titties>

So onto the news that we have seen in the past day:

**Our king is silenced, but not gone!**DeepfuckingValue has tweeted once more!Be sure to note that due to the legal proceedings against him he will not be able to communicate directly to anyone.so symbiology is big in this one, and the things users/twitterers have found in this are astounding!The car is red - this can stand for the stock being red right nowThere are brake marks on the road - meaning it has been stopped in it's tracksThere is a lot of army/resistance between the car and the next traffic sign which is green.This could be interpreted in the following way:We were halted by resistance which made us (or the stock) red, and we will have a lot of resistance before we can get to green, but we will get there!Or it's just a picture of GTA 5, what do I know I eat crayons<https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1359536195689197570?s=20>

Also Melvin, Vlad the stock Impaler and DFV have to appear in congress on Feb 18th<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lh1qxk/robinhood_melvin_capital_citadel_executives/>

Due diligence on why the existing data we have received might be fudged.<https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lgpdj9/why_i_think_existing_data_supports_si_against/>

**WSB still corrupted:**after we received data on how the short interest is still high (even if you believe the Finra report) suddenly WSB became about weed stocks, granted they have peaked, but normally we are ahead of the curve and not sailing people down a river that has already in a peak.Smells like silver according to a lot of speculation on a few boards.<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lh3rf0/funny_how_the_day_after_the_short_sellers_reveal/>

<https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lfwy80/more_proof_wsb_has_sold_out_the_corporate_shills/><https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lfxo74/this_post_is_the_blueprint_and_makes_great_sense/><https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lfta65/fake_gainsmaking_up_numbers_on_wsb_thats_what_it/><https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lftxl2/im_predicting_strong_break_out_into_500_and_will/>

Wsb continues to delete anything positive about GME.Be careful because this can lead to bias.

**Liquidity is drying up for melvin:**as some keen redditors have found out, it seems that melvin is running out of steam.This could be because they lost 53% of their money in Jan and had to borrow money, remember everyday we hold they bleed money in the millions.<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lh2u5t/liquidity_is_drying_up_look_at_how_little_it/>

**Found someone's DD that makes a lot of sense:**I found this member [u/DavidNIOHe](https://www.reddit.com/u/DavidNIOHe/) has done some very good and detailed due diligence on a lot of threads showing a lot of good key points that everyone should readTL-DR Guy is a Chimp among ApesFirst of all: this guy put his money where is mouth is so major respect for that!

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgw2jr/i_really_love_the_stock_and_i_believe_its_the/><https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgraq0/i_could_be_wrong_but_my_research_is_showing_me/><https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lfxv82/important_banana_update/><https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgldm3/why_im_going_to_hold_gme/><https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgnsbj/davidnio_predicts_a_market_crash/>

Be sure to follow this guy as his DD is amazing, I've double checked his work and he is dead on so far as I can tell.

Remember they will try anything to get you to sell:I've made some psychology posts before showing certain tactics they can use.some of the easier tactics are:Letting you feel like you missed outGetting bots/trolls/people talk negative to you to doubt yourselfTreating you like you are in a cult/qanon crapJust remember, why do they care if you are holding ? what do they have to gain if you sell now?

Kevin O'Leary, Mr Wonderful has joined us and spoke up for us:<https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lfl4qt/shark_tanks_kevin_oleary_apps_like_robinhood/>Be sure to also check his personal youtube:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfMxIIdsxGU&ab_channel=KevinO%27Leary>

He has put up 10k to join us, he supports us and he's outspoken about it.Just like Elon musk and Mark Cuban, 3 huge investors are saying to hold the line, who knows better?The people who want to sow FUD or Billionaires who all three where once where we stood!
