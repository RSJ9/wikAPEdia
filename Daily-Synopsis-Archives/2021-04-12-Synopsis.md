Good morning San Diago,

None of this is financial advice, I'm just an ape who found a typewriter with an internet connection

Melvin's story

So a lot of people have been talking about this one, Melvin is down 49% etc etc.

[Remember this video from Cramer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lvpvic/dont_let_the_shills_and_bots_downvote_this_cramer/)

Now let's look at the news articleÂ [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-205342159.html)

"Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop trading frenzy, lost 49% on its investments during the first three months of 2021,Â a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. "

A PERSON FAMILIAR... ok sorry but I'm not believing this until I see some filings backing this claim up, just like Cramer said in the video that a hedge fund manager would create a narrative which was beneficial for them.

How is this beneficial for them? I would have no clue, but I would argue that they will find a way to make this beneficial.

The thing is when it comes to companies they can't make false claims, but if they "leak" information to the press, those liable claims are gone as it was an "anonymous source" and they can still push a story without having to worry about any SEC/governmental litigation .

So when a news story comes out that feeds into your confirmation bias you should be just as sceptical about it as if it where to go against it. remember they know we would love to see a story like this and this could also help them spin a narrative that they want for example:

Melvin closed their short positions due to 49% loss

49% loss forces Melvin capital to take long positions which where short

And these are just two examples from the top of my head.

So again use Critical thinking and think, who would benefit from this, how would they, why would they do this, what could the possible outcome be of that?

Again it's fully possible this entire story is real, but I personally don't trust it to be factual

Just keep an eye out I feel like there is a "melvin covered" story coming so stick with what we know, hodl.

Now this part is fully gut feeling.

For some reason I've been getting the back of my neck standing on edge, I personally feel there will be some new FUD coming something that will require the sub to DO SOMETHING FAST.

So everyone I know most people have a kneejerk reaction and want to help.

There isn't a sense of urgency, so if someone comes here saying HEY DO THIS NOW! please don't.

Question everything and everyone, be kind to one and other and continue to be civil, and move slowly and carefully.

DFV's latest tweet, just look at this beauty!

now let's go over this for a bit,

Exercise none\
-let them expire worthlessly

Exercise some\
- only partially execute (order) his options

Exercise all\
- Buy the full option chain, aka buy all 50k at market.

If you want to add to the vote feel free to chime in if you'd like to.

I personally hope he'll exercise all of them, just imagine if he'd bought 500 at the press of a button, I'm actually wondering what would happen if he exercised the 500 order at once as one block, he'll get them for 12$ a piece so... for me it's a no brainer, if you could pay 1/10th of the current price or less to get something worth the same as the current stock would you? because I would

Will DFV? yeah most likely he bought at 45$ so why wouldn't he get it at 12$

Awesome writeupÂ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mop9pu/%F0%9D%97%9A%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%BA%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%A6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%98%80_%F0%9D%97%98%F0%9D%98%85%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%98%82%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%83%F0%9D%97%B2_%F0%9D%97%97%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%BA_%F0%9D%97%A7%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%BA/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)Â going a bit more in depth on who is on the board, and it's always good to know the company you are investing with and who the people are who run it.

because the people who run it define the company.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!
