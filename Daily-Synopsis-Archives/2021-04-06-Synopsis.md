None of this is financial advice.

Episode IV: A new hope

First of all I want to thank each and every one of the people who joined us here. In my mind this entire thing has never been about one person, or a few, but always thought The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. but the feedback we have all received yesterday was amazing. I'm extremely thankful for the continued trust this community has given us, and I'm extremely humbled by it

But I want to make it clear that none of us are to be looked at as some sort of "messiah" or "leaders", we are just the same people from the same tame trying to do the best we can, and we can only do posts and get our information that we are good with and depend on the others to do their parts. And please, let my former mod team be at peace, we may not have parted ways on the best terms but they did put in a lot of work and deserve some respect imo, and I have no ill will towards them.

I'd also take a moment and extend my gratitude toÂ [r/Spielstopp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spielstopp/)Â for giving me the opportunity to post my side, also mein freunde danke darfur !

Now we all had some experiences inÂ [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/)Â and I like to learn from SWOT and this has lead me to an idea. instead of having 1 mod who does the banning, or 1 mod who does all the DD checking where asked, why not set up teams?

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-06-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/tdbucz0jlir61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc318146af9e753557a280539602f4cb9183e696)](https://preview.redd.it/tdbucz0jlir61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc318146af9e753557a280539602f4cb9183e696)

my thought was this, simple and easy, give mods flair to match so people know who they need to reach out to at a moments notice, making it easier to contact mods for specific reasons.

This does not mean the mods would be limited to just that one role, it means we have a full team, and they would be specializing in stuff but can still help out across the board.

For example Pixel warden and I will be on DD checking for the most part as we are better with that then we are with sub maintenance. so we will have yellow. (just an example)

Let me know what you guys think.

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-06-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/3213ehldmir61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e5e15068fc2047d78cf402918d3ab9de7a42e0c)](https://preview.redd.it/3213ehldmir61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e5e15068fc2047d78cf402918d3ab9de7a42e0c)

Also one thing I want to be very clear about, there is no petty rivalry or animosity betweenÂ [r/gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme/)Â andÂ [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/)Â it's always been about the stonks and it will remain so. cross posting is a 100% ok, because it's not about where we are but who we are. ape don't fight ape.

So lets all move forward with one singular goal, the stonk.

Now let's get onto the real news shall we!

Given the current situation it's easy to spread FUD, please play no heed to this as per usual, we are not splintered in any sence of the word we are just merely on more subs now

Nothing changed, and we are still the same community, just spread across multiple boards.

[u/Scalpel_Jockey9965](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scalpel_Jockey9965/)Â Did a great write up on the new OCC filingÂ SR-OCC-2021-004

[which can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mkphuq/new_occ_filing_seeks_to_amend_the_process_for/)

This new rule change amends the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Rule 1104.What's really interesting about this rule is that it provides an order of events in the case that an options clearing member is suspended.

When an options clearing member is suspended, their current positions are then auctioned off to other OCC members. The proceeds from these auctions are then used to close out their other high risk positions.

Guess who's a OCC member? Shitadel!

Normally a liquidation was by invite only, but with the new amended rules it means it's entire portfolio is up for grabs for any other member, this means in turn that the have a better chance of recouping their losses faster and easier, and also means they are currently preparing for war. (note Citadel has hired an ex SEC high profile dude, you don't hire a woodworker if you have no use for them)

[u/c-digs](https://www.reddit.com/user/c-digs/)Â did a great writeup of the new rules of theÂ SR-DTC-2021-004Â andÂ SR-OCC-2021-801Â in ELIA

(Explain It Like I'm Ape)Â [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mkju4s/srdtc2021004_and_srocc2021801_for_apes/)

it goes through what the 004-005 and 801 mean and how these all are inter connected so that they can use one to trigger the other. (for example, having a VAR assessment daily by using 002 then using the 801 to check the minimum requirements and use 004/005 to margin call them and liquify their assets in order to offset the financial requirements).

the new rulings are bullish imo and will cause a ripple effect.

We are currently still seeing the ripples from Archegos going on

How this will continue or what further affects it will have are unsure right now, but by having one topple usually means the next one isn't far off as the hedgefunds are interconnected to one and other but in what sense they are still remains to be seen.

Game stop 3.5 million share offering

So I wrote about this yesterday as well but I would like to get it in the daily just so that we have a good overview and amend it where needed.

GameStop Announces At-The-Market Equity Offering Program

Company Can Sell Up to 3.5 Million Shares and Intends to Use Any Proceeds to Further Accelerate Transformation and Strengthen Balance Sheet

GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company") today announced that it has filed aÂ prospectus supplementÂ with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), under which it may offer and sell up to aÂ maximum of 3,500,000Â shares of its common stock (the "Common Stock")Â from time to timeÂ through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "ATM Offering"). The Company intends to use the net proceeds from any sales of its Common Stock under the ATM Offering to further accelerate its transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening its balance sheet. The timing and amount of any sales will be determined by a variety of factors considered by the Company.

Common Stock will be offered through Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies"), which is serving as the sales agent. Jefferies may sell Common Stock by any lawful method deemed to be an "at-the-market offering" defined by Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including without limitation, sales on any existing trading market. Sales may be made at market prices prevailing at the time of a sale or at prices related to prevailing market prices. As a result, sales prices may vary.

GameStop's prospectus supplement filed today supplements information contained in the accompanying prospectus contained in the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-251197) for the offering of Common Stock. Potential investors should review the prospectus, the prospectus supplement and all other related documents that GameStop has filed with the SEC for complete corporate information, including information pertaining to the ATM Offering and the risks associated with investing in the Company.

Please note that this press release is for informational purposes only and it does not represent an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Company's Common Stock. In no event will the Company sell more than 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Offering, and aggregate gross proceeds will not exceed $1,000,000,000.

They didn't sell a single share from that previous filing at $300, $400, $500.

It's not a new offering and it doesn't mean they'll be initiating an offering. They're simply expanding the ability to offer. It also means that they can sell for up to $1,000,000,000 now instead of only $100,000,000. I believe this means they'll offer when the price is incredibly high to maximize share price for fewer shares.

See it as a guy offering his car for 100 bucks, only to realize it's worth way more and ask 1500 for it.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.
