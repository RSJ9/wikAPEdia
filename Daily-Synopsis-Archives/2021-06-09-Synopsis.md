Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

SPARTAAAANS!

Reverse Repo

Just like clockwork, the reverse repo is going up once again, 497 Billion for 46 participants.

Yeah they need cash for some reason, and the most logical one for me is the meme stocks (GME AMC BB NOK etc), because¬†[u/Rossaldihno](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rossaldihno/)¬†found something yesterday which is a headscratcher at minimum.

BRK-A inversed of GME

at the same time we've seen gme spike we have seen everything else go down, from the rest of the market they normally hedge with, to even crypto going down just before Green days.

if it happens once or twice it can be a coincidence, when it keeps happening it's a pattern.

$clov

So you've most likely seen the ticker $clov get spammed lately, but some smart apes found out Citadel LLC 13-F filing for 523,775 shares of $CLOV. and guess what sub is currently shilling this one hard.

SEC webinar

Thanks to¬†[u/chosedemarais](https://www.reddit.com/u/chosedemarais/)¬†we have a play by play of this meeting, just like the House of financial hearing, it was nothing more than a circle jerk and everyone saying we are doing the best with giving non answers.

From russel 2000 to 1000

Yesterday I linked to a thread going into some detail on the entire thing that is the change of the russel 2000 to 1000, that user has given an update on that so I thought I should link it for everyone to see ;)

Satori: The One Week Security Update

The annual shareholder meeting

Ok let's get over a couple of basics here just to be sure.

There is no media allowed to attend the meeting, from experience this tells me that they wont be able to get inside but they will still be outside trying to make every retail investor look like a fucking idiot.

There will be paid shills outside making a mockery or trying to pull some bullshit, so lets agree on some guidelines if you're a real ape attending.

1.  Dress accordingly, this doesn't mean wear a suit but don't look like a basement dweller who never sees sunlight.

2.  Be polite, be OVERLY nice, remember be excellent even outside the sub, they want to paint you as retards, don't give them the chance

3.  Be sure to pick up your trash, don't dump shit and just let it sit there, clean up after yourselves.

4.  If you guys gather do so peacefully

5.  There will be people trying to cause a scene (remember the paid shills here?), distance yourselves from them, do not engage no matter what

6.  Keep in the back of your mind that everyone will be watching, they've said horrible things about us, prove them wrong by being the most respectable, most Excellent shareholders ever.

I have faith that even the most smooth brained apes here can do this without any trouble, make papa Cohen proud.

But it will be more than just GME doing the streaming, we'll be joining in as well!

Because we expect George Sherman to have the same monotone and deadpan delivery (I'm still expecting him to be booted after this), we're going to go over their Annual shareholder meeting live on the Superstonk youtube channel.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Countdown to the Annual shareholder meeting is today, LETS GO!

Majora's Short

Before I go there are a few things I want to make clear to everyone, today is the shareholders meeting, this doesn't mean everything will pop off today, the announcements that are being made today can take weeks to take full swing.

If we hear about NFT dividends, it wont be issued right here right now, the odds are greater we'll see this in a few weeks, if we hear about new business ventures, mergers etc these things take time.

Remember we can stay ape longer then they can stay solvent ;)

For all my apes out there I love you and if you're out there in Grapevine, you may see some familiar faces from here pop up <3 be Excellent to each other !
