Goodmorning everyone,

I am Rensole, and welcome to the morning news

*insert flashy intro card*

we like the stonks

The hearing:

The hearing will take place on Thursday, February 18th at 12:00pm E.T

This is 18:00 Central European time (Brussels).[You can watch it here](https://financialservices.house.gov/live/)

Ok so we have a hearing, now what?

Well one of the things I would recommend at this point is emailing your representative

[Like this thread describes](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/llm89h/pls_email_your_reps_template_for_congress_inside/)

Some people have said in the past that the government wont do anything for them, but they can't afford to NOT do anything now. Due to the fact that the GME situation is bigger then just USA, it has millions of investors from all across the globe they are forced to intervene. Otherwise they may force a crash, as if the world stage would no longer have faith in the usa's system they can pull out, resulting in a firesale.

They have to do something now, and the worlds eyes are on them and they know it. That's why Sen Waters has spoken out in a letter, as did AOC.

The people being called to senate tomorrow

Also this may be a small thing, but it appears that Gabriel Plotkin is divorcing his wife. His (now former) spouse filed for divorce on Jan 31st.This may be an actual divorce, or a way of making sure their assets are safe if Melvin go's bankrupt, or gets personally pointed as a liability, in which case they could go after his personal property as per law.

Again this can be something or it can be nothing, I just think it's weird timing, and I've seen rich people take care of their assets in a similar way in 2008.

Edit: There has been speculation on the divorce but as of right now there is no verified source.

Melvin is the new Ups/Fedex

So now onto the FTD's

You've most likely seen these threads over the past few weeks, that the outstanding shares are extremely high right? well Melvin doesn't like sharing his toys as we now all have noticed.

Well first of all let's check the FTD's

The GME Failure to Deliver data from the second half of January

1/15 892,653\
1/19 1,498,576\
1/20 1,007,562\
1/21 1,438,994\
1/22 273,600\
1/25 275,113\
1/26 2,099,572\
1/27 1,972,862\
1/28 1,032,986\
1/29 138,179

Danm that's a lot right? I mean they must have bought back onto gme and everything is over right?\
NOPE!\
There is a ETF which can best be explained with actual pies.\
A stock is a pie, lets say GMEis apple pie, the ETF is a collection of pies, so instead of being all one pie, it has a piece of apple, a piece of rhubarb and lots of others mixed together.\
When you buy GME you get a slice of apple.\
But the ETF is a mixed bag, giving you slices of all kinds of different pies.

so let's look at our friendly GME heavy ETF (XRT):

1/15 10,187\
1/19 9,134\
1/20 1,144\
1/21 17,703\
1/22 23,125\
1/25 112,536\
1/26 127,661\
1/27 80,112\
1/28 385,651\
1/29 2,218,348

In just a few days it go's from 1144 to over two million!

This is called "creative bookkeeping" by doing this you can say no no we are clean here, while have the full amount written off to a shell corp.<https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm>

Positions

so I've also seen a lot of posts on here saying "show me your position" or something along those lines.**!!!DONT POST YOUR POSITIONS!!!!**Seriously that could fuck every one of us, why? Because then the people who are manipulating the stock know up to which point they need to let this go. because selling at a loss is not someone should ever do in this situation. But being cock teased at the point you bought in for a week hits differently. Because at that point it's a break even point. And if you can get out with no loss, but you're able to break even is something a lot of people can or will do.

So I repeat, DO NOT POST YOUR INFO.THIS IS NOT A "POST POSITION OR BAN SUB"

Volumes

As some more astute redditors have seen in the past 2 weeks, the volume is dying down. This may be because the more we buy the less stocks they have to play around with, which if true.... hahahaha

[XRT and GME plotted on top of each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ll8czb/i_plotted_the_sec_data_from_the_second_half_of/)

just to give this a bit of context:<https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051415/risks-trading-lowvolume-stocks.asp>^not going to synopsis this, just read the entire thing. In short it's good for us.

linked together with that is that some users are having a hard time getting their orders filled.<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lloxut/i_love_bananas_so_i_placed_an_order_i_wonder_why/>

So maybe we are starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel and there aren't enough stocks to go about right now, meaning that stimmy better hit quick.

also a video that may be a good thing to watch:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lll1oz/very_important_video_take_the_time_xrt_etf_is/>

Also just called GameStop;

Again as always, none of this is financial advice.

If I missed anything let me know and I'll edit and include it here!

Edit: user [u/stonkyfarts](https://www.reddit.com/u/stonkyfarts/) may be on to something.This is a theory he has on how multiple companies are involved in the manipulation of the stonk.<https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonBets/comments/ll65ei/s3_partners_gme_manipulation/>

Edit2: u/ [Wingardienleviosah](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wingardienleviosah) pointed out that he has made a template for people to use to email legislators in the senate. EVEN IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THE USA!!
