For anyone unfamiliar with how to read candles, green candles mean the stock closed higher than it opened, and red vise versa. The wicks are the highs and lows price hit in the aggregation period (ie. daily is 1 candle/day, 5m is 1 candle per 5m etc), for green candles, the base is the open and the top is the close. Red the top is the open and the bottom is the close.
