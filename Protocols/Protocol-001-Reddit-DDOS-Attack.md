# Protocol 001: What to do when Reddit goes down?

**Disclaimer:** This is *literally* not financial advice, nor am I a financial advisor. I'm a strategy and operations manager with very few wrinkles on my brain.

This is my personal protocol in the event that Reddit crashes.

What would I do in the event that Reddit crashes?

## Step 1: Breathe

This is exactly what you would expect to happen as your fellow apes have been discussing for quite some time. Take a deep breathe, regain your composure, [check off your bingo card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpadm6/its_time_to_play_bingo_of_the_week/) and strap in for a bumpy ride.

## Step 2: Check other Social Media Outlets

For Twitter, you do not need an account to view tweets. However, you will not be able to see comments on a tweet without an account.

You also do not need an account to view live streams or videos on YouTube.

You **do** need an account for Discord.

\*May be compromised

\*\*Yes, I realize the community may have split opinions on AndrewMoMoney, but at the end of the day he has a platform for apes to flock to.

**Note:** If you know of any other trustworthy sources, let me know and I will update this table

## Step 2a: Be very skeptical of MSM

This one is for the boomers who are not technically savvy and may turn to MSM to get their information while Reddit is down. MSM has rarely reported the truth about GME. They are quick (sometimes [from the future quick](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpholj/wow_that_is_some_really_good_reporting_wish_i/)) to let the world know when GME is in the red, and when GME has positive news or is in the green, they question it or spin the news into a negative.

Why would MSM start reporting the truth when the rocket is about to launch?

## Step 3: DO NOT MAKE ANY IMPULSIVE DECISIONS

The HFs entire goal of bringing down Reddit is to split the apes up, cause panic, and force apes to make decisions without thinking them through. If you see any *urgent* actions on social media or MSM:

1. **Repeat step 1**
2. Maybe even get yourself off once or twice (I bet you were too busy sticking crayons up your nose to remember that Reddit is home to one of the largest NSFW content collections on the internet)
3. and re-evaluate the urgent action.

If MSM is yelling at me to sell, the joke is on them. I can't even set my floor price on my broker currently, nor have I been able to find my sell button. I only know how to buy and hodl.

Remember, there are many great DDs explaining how the MOASS will last for days, maybe even weeks.

## Step 4: Hang in there

**Repeat step 1**. Grab some popcorn, your favorite beverage, and enjoy the wild ride. Tendies are closer than they have ever been.
