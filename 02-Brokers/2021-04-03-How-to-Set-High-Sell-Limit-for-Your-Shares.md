Added pics for fidelity --See Edit #3 belowÂ *(fidelity only allows these orders to placed during trade hours but once done will be in the system)*

I have seen where many people are upset they can not put in a sell order for 1,000,000.00 or whatever per share

On a regular trade order my broker (td ameritrade) wont let you put the price very high either BUT if you go in and do aÂ *"Conditional Contingent TRIGGER Order"*Â you can set a very high sale price.

This is for TD Ameritrade but it also works in Fidelity and I am sure most brokers. The tabs at your broker may be a little different but this will give you an idea

Step One: Go to Trade tab and go down and click on CONDITIONAL

Trade Tab Td Ameritrade

Step #2 -- Under "Condition" select "Contingent order (Trade Trigger)"

Step #3 -- Fill out the "Condition Section" that will trip the TRIGGER

Step #4 -- Fill out the ACTION section (what you want to happen if trigger is tripped)

*NOTE the circle date. If you want the order to last (up to six months) make sure you change this date to match the date above. For some reason, at least with TD Ameritrade even if you select "Good To Canceled" and the 6 month date comes up the order will still expire the next day unless you also change the date "set to expire"*

Step #5 --- Review the order and then submit it

Now when you want to Check your order. You go to "Orders" but it does not show up where your regular orders show up. You have to click on the "contingent"Â tab.

One thing to REMEMBER though. If you put in 1,000,000 and you decide at 900,000 that you have to sell because its topping out remember to either change the contingent order to lower or cancel it before you sell at another price. If you try to do a regular trade order at 900,000 for all your shares it will REJECT it saying you would be oversold because it is still accounting for the 1,000,000 contingent order

Edit #1 -- fixed some spelling errors

Edit #2 -- Getting alot of down votes. Shills must not be happy. They dont want alot of high sell orders for some reason. maybe a ton of high sell orders will affect the trading algorithms and make it go up faster. Not sure. Gotta be a reason for the down votes

Edit #3. I am adding picture for Fidelity. One thing with fidelity is they do not accept conditional contingent trigger orders unless market is open so you would have to do it during the week during trade hours. But once it is done it will be in the system

place your order

Edit #4 - It was pointed out to me that this did not include extended hours (td Ameritrade). There is a GTC + Ext hours option. I should have used it for this DD but did not

Edit #5 --Â i have been told that people can not get this done on phone apps. I am not sure because i never use phone for financial stuff.Â Definitely works on laptop or desktop.Â *Update see Edit #8*

Edit #6Â -- Some great feedback about what if the trigger is hit and market drops some and your order does not activate. So you could say set the trigger at 800,000 (or whatever) and that triggers the order to become active then in the order you put sell, GME, and then your limit of 1M or whatever (so it activates at 800k but does not sell until 1M) or you could do a stop or trailing stop if your worried it may go over 1M. Pesonally if I am out working without internet and my XXX shares sell at 1 million each and I miss out on more I am fine with being a hundreds millionaire.

I am somewhat new to this. i just found a way to do the high price order. I work where there is no internet so it gives me some confidence I wont miss it. And if the DD is correct it will last for days. I also will be setting multiple triggers selling a few shares here and there at different high prices.

Edit #7Â ---Â This is just a thought but for everyone who only use phone moble apps and it is not working on the app try this. Instead of using the app use the phones internet browser and log into the actual brokerage website and try doing it throught their website. I bet that will work

Edit #8Â -- people asking about Schwab. Dont have account there but this link should help

Edit #10Â Contingents must be enabled first!Â CreditÂ [/U/Jaykvam](https://www.reddit.com/user/jaykvam)

*" To do so, hover over*Â *Client Services**, then click either*Â *My Profile*Â *or*Â *General**. In the right-hand column, under*Â *Elections & routing**, see whether Contingents (Trade Triggersâ„¢) is Disabled or Enabled. It must be enabled to use contingent conditional orders. It's not difficult to enable but does require you to*Â ~~*read and*~~Â *sign a short a agreement (Do read it in advance though!). "*
