[Education 👨‍🏫 | Data 🔢](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Education%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%8F%AB%20%7C%20Data%20%F0%9F%94%A2%22&restrict_sr=1)

The swedes have been fighting with Avanza over this for weeks now. On the Swedish sub iskbets a post have gained traction about a Swedish ape calling the financial inspection agency to talk about this. He got the answer that this indeed seems like malpractice and that we should contact the "konsumentverket" and make a complaint.

So all swedes reading this, go to [www.konsumentverket.se](http://www.konsumentverket.se/) and make a complaint. We are getting royaly fucked

EDIT: Avanzas clearing bank is BNP Paribas. BNP was heavily involved with the Panama papers. As soon as this is over I'm getting the duck out of there.
