Good morning EuroApes, good morning BritApes, good morning international Apes!

As your self-appointed patron saint of¬†*les miserables*¬†confined to trading on eToro, I present you this five-step checklist to make sure your eToro Account is all set for our trip to Tendietown. Please note that I am not a financial advisor, and none of this should be interpreted as financial advice.

Get your favourite crayons to snack on, put your intelligent face on, and let's GO!

1\. Two-Factor Auth

We all hate 2FA, I know. Just like cookies, they take the fun out of the internet. But please turn it on - you don't want to be caught locked out of your own account right after the rocket took off. Sounds paranoid? You bet! There's a lot at stake here, you¬†*should*¬†be paranoid.

Go to settings, then to Account, then to Two Factor Authentication.

2\. Private Profile

People with private profiles inserting themselves in eToro discussions are frowned upon. Well, fuck that. You don't need eToro's poorly-moderated community posts: Superstonk is your home! Protect your identity ahead of the MOAS(S), set your profile to private.

Go to settings, then to Privacy, and uncheck the two boxes for Public Account and Full name.

3\. Your Account Manager

Now, I am not sure whether everyone has access to an Account Manager. I think this is tied to how much $‚Ç¨¬£ you're working with. But if you¬†*do*¬†have access to this feature, go ahead and introduce yourself. They respond quicker than Customer Support.

For this you need to visit Club Dashboard, which you should find above 'Invite Friends'.

4\. Keep records

I don't trust any broker, and neither should you. Again, there's a lot at stake here. Fuckery may be afoot. Screenshots are good, but Account Statements are better. Download these regularly, you might need those docs one day. No need to read them: Just download, back up, done.

Go to settings, then to Account, scroll down to Account Statement, click View, fill out the dates.

(*Tip: I do this once a week, and my start date is always 24.01.2021, the day before I first bought GME)*

5\. No SL/TP!

You didn't think your clogs-wearing Ape would sign off without emphasising the most important, did you? Check every single position, including That Movie Stock if you hold any, and be sure Stop Loss and Take Profit are turned OFF. Not zero, not 1000%. OFF!

Go to your portfolio, click on the name of a stock or the little gear, check your settings.

Alright Apies, I hope this little guide serves you well. Let me know if you have any questions, and please do call me out when I missed something. Remember the MOAS could start tomorrow, on the 10th of June, or in a couple of months. No matter what, hedgies are fukt and shorts must be covered.

Keep the faith, buy and hodl, think of an exit strategy when you are selling on the way down. I will now tend to my tulips and I wish you all a wonderful Sunday.

APES TOGETHER...!!
