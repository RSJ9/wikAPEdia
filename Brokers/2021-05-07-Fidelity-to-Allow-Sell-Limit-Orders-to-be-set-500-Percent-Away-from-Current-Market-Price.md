Hello members of the [r/fidelityinvestments](https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/) community. We have seen many posts discussing our policies on limit orders. These are some of the most upvoted posts on our subreddit. The discussion focused around the ability to place limit orders outside of the 50% limitation from the current price of the stock.

We've listened to your feedback and we are pleased to announce a change to our policy. As of today, sell limit orders are now allowed to be set 500% away from the current market price. Buy limit orders will be allowed to be entered starting at $.01.

| Stock Price | Prior Sell Limit Max | New Sell Limit Max |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $100 | $150 | $600 |

The calculation is:

(Stock Price x 500%) + Stock Price = New Sell Limit Max

We are still in the process of updating the rule for contingent orders to 500%. We are expecting that change to occur in the next few months. Stay tuned to our subreddit for additional updates. We value the feedback you are providing and are focused on updates and enhancements that are important to you.

To better clarify the new changes we removed the original post and posted with the updated calculation.
