Hi! I use revolut and was able to set a 1mil sales limit. I contacted support and they said for sell there shouldn't be a limit. It seems the limit is for purchasing The only drawback seems to be that it expires daily - [u/Ampedrosa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ampedrosa/)

Hello fellow ape, I saw your post on the exit strategy and I really fucking love you. I'm a UK based ape on Revolut, I had a whole convo with them yesterday about how they will act during the squeeze. I pressed on more details about "high risk" situations in which they would liquidate us early, but basically they told me even Revolut doesn't know what "high risk" means for the broker Drivewealth... One more important thing they told me, that you might want to add to the post, is about the limit on selling, I asked them if we can go above 10k: "If you sell exactly the amount of shares you own, the trade will go through even if the number of shares/total amount in USD is higher or lower than the limit. You can do that through tapping on the "Max" button (which is above the keyboard) when submitting the order. Your Order might not be accepted if it gives rise to too much risk for the Third Party Broker or if trading is no longer available or is suspended in the Instrument your Order relates to." Can't send screenshots in here but as soon as I figure it out, I can send you the conversation. Thank you for your awesome work !! [user name censored on /rGME]

https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m8nk84/important_all_apes_need_to_read_this_to_prepare/ Hello! Im a Revolut user and i contacted them, as we know we can't sell above 10.000 $ per share BUT they told me this: NOTE: Only if you sell as "market order". "As we have checked here, if you sell exactly the amount of shares you own, the trade will go through even if the number if shares/total amount in USD is higher or lower than the limit. You can do this through tapping in the 'Max' button (which is above the keyboard) when submiting the order" - [u/xZetroX](https://www.reddit.com/u/xZetroX/)

Hey ! I saw your great post about limit sell for each broker. Really good job ! I did some research on Revolut and some fellow apes gave a solution to do limit sell at any price point. (1M+ validated, i can do screenshot) You just have to have a round number of share and put a limit sell for all your share at once. On the other hand, we weren't able to verify if we can do this with more than 500 shares (we don't have that much unfortunately) -u/caribouteille
