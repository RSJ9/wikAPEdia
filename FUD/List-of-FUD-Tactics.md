### A Running List of FUD
**Author: [u/ayyyybro](https://www.reddit.com/user/ayyyybro/)**

Apes have been through a lot these last few months. There is no end to hedge fuckery.

Below is a list of notable times they tried to FUD Apes out of their positions.

When it comes time to hold past 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M.

Remember this list.

Feel free to post additional examples and I will update.

As we get closer to the MOASS, they will try DESPERATELY to hype a low price point like $1,000 to scare you into paper handing.

**Don’t ever forget how hard they tried to get you to move on.**

Think of how much they have spent trying to get you to sell. How much do the paid shills alone cost in total? How much is that worth to you?

If you’ll indulge me for a sec I just watched The Big Short for the 3rd time and I’m ready to move on so I think I’ll run Herb Brooks’ speech on repeat for the next 420 hours

[“Great moments are born from great opportunity.”]{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdmyoMe4(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdmyoMe4iHM)

They have the deep pockets.

They have the technology.

They have the experts.

They have the experience.

They have the resources.

**And they’re still fucked.**

9 out of 10 times, Wall Street wins. But not this time.
