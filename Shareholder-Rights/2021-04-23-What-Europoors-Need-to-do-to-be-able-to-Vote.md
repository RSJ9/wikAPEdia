First of all (thx for the comment to remind me) :

There are no immediate actions needed. No urgent, it is not a "do-this-now" & no organized mass actions. It is just for information purposes only and help other apes go through the voting. So relax, read that slowly, make your own decision & don't hesitate to share some info with us to enrich that post.

EDIT11,12,13,14,15,16, 17, 18,19 : *LAST UPDATE : 08/05/2021 11:24 BRUSSELS TIME* *:*

*added some brokers even oustide EU & alphabetical reorganisation + fixes with new inputs*

EDIT10 : *24/04/2021 08:01 BRUSSELS TIME :*

It seems that lot of EU brokers say AT FIRST that they don't allow to vote for US stocks. BUT, it seems that if you ask them directly for a certificate which officially confirms your holding on the 15th of April (which can be free or required a payment depending of the broker check the list at the end); and that you send it to gme; you may be able to get a control number. Nothing set in stones yet.

I'm contacting Investors Relations hoping I'll get an answer and I'll update that post.

*You may experience different answers that others apes had, don't take what is gathered here as the absolute and unique truth* 🙏 *always check directly with your broker* 🙏 *and if you have a new info, write it in the comment I'll update the thread.*

💎 Hi Fellow apes / GME investors ! 💎

The day has come to make yourself heard. I know some of you are not used to vote; but in the coming days your actions may be decisives.

✋ **FIRST CHECK AT THE END OF THE THREAD & IN THE COMMENTS TO SEE IF YOUR BROKER IS LISTED TO AVOID SPAMMING THEM** ✋ ~~*IMPORTANT with some brokers if you register to vote you're unable to sell the shares (you registered) before the shareholders meeting date. For the ones that are scare to miss anything, remember, you can register a fraction of it.*~~ *That info IS wrong (it has been checked twice) since the custodian date is already in the past. If you have any doubt call your broker.*

If you want to vote : It depends on which BROKER you are but the majority of them don't automatically transfer you the PROXY statement specifically when it concerns shareholders meeting related to US stocks.

What you would need to do :

1.  Call your broker and tell him that GME released the "Information required for the Proxy Statement"

2.  Ask them how to proceed to VOTE (don't be shy, don't hesitate to ask for a full detailed answer, there are no dumb questions at that point). You can say that you read that you need a CONTROL NUMBER.

NOW depending of your broker they can say several things :

1.  No problem, we'll send you all the related paperwork and your control number

=> GREAT just proceed

=> Go on [HERE](https://www.investorelections.com/GME) and follow the steps (it's the official link from the [DEFA14A](https://investor.gamestop.com/node/18841/html))

2) Sorry we are not used to do that, I'll check with my supervisor.

=> Not so GREAT but it's OK; just give them a day or two, if no news, maybe you should CALL THEM AGAIN.

3) Sorry we bought your shares through an American Broker and it doesn't allow you to participate in the VOTE

=> if you want to go further, ASK them for a detailed written mail of WHY you can't participate.

=> IF they don't send you that mail in a couple days, maybe it is time to CALL THEM BACK ask why. *Don't fall for the conspiracy theory, maybe it's just regular business that you can't vote; not everybody read the tiny notes on all brokers contracts. Take that as a lesson for next time.*

Once you get the mail, contact the INVESTOR RELATIONS of GAMESTOP by mail or phone (once again don't be shy, you're not stupid) :

Investor Relations Phone: *001 817 424-2001* Email: [*investorrelations@gamestop.com*](mailto:investorrelations@gamestop.com)

Check with them if they can help and if there is something that can be done.

If not, you didn't waste your time since the Investor Relations at Gamestop will surely record your statement and archive that in case they want to proceed with a thourough investigation on why you were unable to vote. Or they can just register it and have a better idea of how many persons are in your situation.

You did all that? GREAT, you can go back doing nothing.

-------------------------------------

Don't hesitate to share your experience with your broker (name it) to help to other fellow apes.

I'm with BOLERO, I contacted them this morning, they said that they will send me all the details on how to proceed. The woman was kind of clueless since she needed to wait for her colleagues to address my issue. I'll keep you in touch on how it goes.

PEACE

🚀 List of brokers and related info from the Comments 🚀 :

*(since I can't verify everything I rely on trust, always check directly by calling the broker yourself)*

- ABN AMRO : All clear. Apparently, no extra costs, they send an email with the proxyvote link and the code required to login.

- AJ Bell (UK) : Can't vote via proper channel, stored in CREST.

- Avanza : Voting with Avanza is not possible outside the EU, according to <https://www.avanza.se/kundservice.html/457/hur-anmaler-jag-mig-till-en-bolagsstamma/?categoryId=348>

- Avenue (Brazilian) : Need to call the broker.

- Baader Bank : Seems possible waiting for more info.

- Belfius : Apparently can't vote through dedicated proxy.

- Binckbank : Should be eligible, go to "mij rekening/instellingen/producten en diensten => digital voting by proxy (5€/vote)

> Other apes who contacted them told me that BinckBank doesn't allow to vote for US stocks. As all brokers they can deliver a certificate but we don't know yet if it's enough to get a code for the vote.

- BMO Investorline : Shoud automatically send the document online, if not, call them.

- BNP PARIBAS / SMARTBROKER : You should receive an invitation for the vote in your (mail) account. From there you can request your right to vote for free!

- Bolero : They don't automatically send you the proxy. They are waiting for the paperwork that should arrive by mid-May, need to be contacted back at that time. Apparently no extra costs.

- Broker Ninety Nine : Apparently can't vote.

- Comdirect : Should send the paperwork mid-May. Apparently no extra costs.

- Dad.at : ~~charges 150€ to register you for the meeting.~~ Apparently it's 40€.

- Danske Bank : (copy/paste)

Danske Bank (in Finland) told me that the request to vote in an international company's meeting was rare, but after looking into it said it could be done. Looks like there is a relatively standard form and some piece of procedure on the bank's behalf that needs to be done - they fill and submit the paperwork for you, and they essentially just need the information for the "Voting instruction:" -field of the form. They do charge a pretty hefty EUR 75 + VAT fee, though.

- Degiro : Read below! Just need to inform your broker and pay 10€. All clear.

~~*Warning for Degiro users there are sources that say that these shares are blocked until the date of the meeting and cannot, therefore, be sold. So just register a fraction of it*~~ [~~*Link*~~](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.degiro.ch/data/pdf/ch-en/ISI%2520-%2520Corporate%2520Actions.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjWmPLGzvvvAhW1aRUIHVkJCGEQFjAMegQIDRAC&usg=AOvVaw19YJJG0RwQTDy2l0RoD4rx) That info is WRONG (it has been checked twice) you can vote without blocking your shares. Check with your broker if you have any doubt.

> However ('cause life isn't simple) other sources say that it doesn't block anything since the custodian date was earlier (which make sense for me) : <https://i.imgur.com/co9Q61H.png>

(copy/paste) *Although you are trading the value of the underlying real asset, you are not issued a stock issuance certificate or allocated voting rights and your name is not registered under the share register. Nonetheless, should the company issue dividends, your balance will be updated in accordance with your holding*

- FLATEX : Flatex charges you EUR 5,90 for the certificate showing that you are the proper owner of the shares in your Depot. You need to mail this certificate then to Gamestop (Investor relation) and let them know that you want to participate in the shareholder meeting and prior to it already to the election

~~*It seems that it is not possible for flatex customers to participate in the vote without getting blocked from trading the shares unfortunately. (same as degiro) - so register a fraction of it*~~ *check degiro line*

- Fineco : Possible to vote, need to contact the broken, FEE for voting 100 GBP.

- Trade Republic : it seems that you can't vote.**
