Hi all,
None of this is financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor.


Looks like my last prediction based on GME's FTD reset Cycles was correct give or take 1 day (I called May 14, but we actually saw the movements on May 13). Because of this, i'm taking a second stab at calling the next FTD reset cycle/s.

I've highlighted the previous cycles, how they've supposedly ocurred and their results. I've also added the future reset Cycles and what to possibly expect before and after they occur.
Keep in mind that the GME wedge ends somewhere around the 5'th of June, so i've flagged all FTD reset events around that area for your viewing.


1) Keep in mind that the FTD reset cycles don't equal squeeze territory. At this point in time they indicate periods of "interesting" price movement.

2) There was interestingly high amounts of shorting that is extremely visible (to me at least) for this last T+35 period (Pink Colour) which to me indicates desperation by the shorts to bring this down and/or them knowing we're near the end so they're rattling the cage they're locked in trying to get out... I don't know for sure, but that's what the pink colored parts of the chart are telling me. It's the first time they didn't reset FTDs before T+21 but instead re-shorted more with the intent of resetting at T+35. If that drastic change of tactics doesn't indicate desperation, i don't know what does.

3) I've drawn with Red/Green lines that indicate the possible directionality before/after the FTD reset cycles. These are quite guestimated and it's my first time trying to guestimate the direction before/after an FTD reset based on past directional changes, so don't take this data seriously. It's more of a first test for myself to see the accuracy of my current guestimations. I'll be improving the accuracy of these guestimations/data extrapolations as time progresses. To be honest, i don't think this will drag on so long that i'll have time to gather more data to extrapolate more accurate direction movement during/before/after FTD resets, but ok... whatever, you never know.

4) A large enough runaway price move that cannot be controlled by the shorts is all it will take to get this train going. We don't know when, how and what will cause this. All we need to do is hold and wait.

5) Possible catalysts still include:
- Ryan Cohen exercising his right to buy +7 million more shares. He can likely exercise this after the shareholder meeting.
- Overvoting (More votes than share float).
- CUSIP change? (Unconfirmed, my own theory)
- Share recall (Unconfirmed, my own theory)
- Share Split (Possible, but unlikely to happen due to financial requirements)
- Dividend (Possible, but unlikely due to financial requirements)
- Joining a new Index like the Russel 1000 or others (Unconfirmed, my own theory)
- Shorts capitulating (Possible, but will take patience and holding as the shorts are bled dry)

Right now there's nothing else to do with GME other than to buy and hold.

None of this is financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor. I'm just a guy from a village that's owned GME since January for his entire life's worth & more who's done endless due diligence to be sure his investment will pay off.
