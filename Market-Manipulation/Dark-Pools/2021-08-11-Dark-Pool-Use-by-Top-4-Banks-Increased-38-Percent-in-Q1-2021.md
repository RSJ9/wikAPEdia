Part 1 of 7

This began as an investigation into the correlations from 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2021 stock market crashed and debt ceiling issues.

It turned into my biggest nightmare and there's no good outcome. Buy Calls on my therapist... $65 strike price...

*** This is correction to the title as it should say "Dark Pool Use By Top 4 BANK NOW 61.8 %" for full transparency, but can't edit ***

As of 8/1/21 we are entering a new debt ceiling crisis with congress on a 6 week vacation, combined with an expired rent moratorium where 6.2 million renters face evictions, the homeowners of said tenant's houses will likely never receive back-pay for rent owed possibly causing record high bankruptcies akin to 2008 or worse, and without taking this into account, CBO projects a federal budget deficit of $3.0 trillion this year as the economic disruption caused by the 2020--2021 coronavirus pandemic, while the legislation enacted in response continue to boost the deficit (which was large by historical standards even before the pandemic).

In August 2011, during the debt ceiling crisis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the federal budget would show a deficit of close to $1.5 trillion, or 9.8 percent of GDP.

That is nearly 1 percentage point higher than the shortfall recorded in 2010 and almost equal to the deficit posted in 2009, which at 10.0 % of GDP was the highest in nearly 65 years at the time.

At 13.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP), the deficit in 2021 would be the second largest since 1945, exceeded only by the 14.9 % shortfall recorded in 2020.

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2019, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.3 %.

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 14.1 %, which in my opinion and as shown below by these reports is due almost entirely to the insanely high level of newly printed money and covid stimulus payments, making it completely artificial, in my opinion w/ proof below**.**

<https://www.cbo.gov/publication/21999>

The CBO estimates from 2011 would be heaven compared to the reality we're facing, which is a crippled economy and stock market on the verge of collapse. Evidence below;

In 2011 CBO projected the 3 month Treasury bill to be worth 4.4% in 2021.

The actual 3 month Treasury bill rate for July 2021 is worth between 0.01 and 0.06%.

In 2011 the projected 10 year Treasury note bill rate was projected to be 5.4% for 2021

The actual 10 year Treasury note bill rate is 1.24% In July 2021

7/29/2021

Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Beureau of Economic Analysis, on the Gross Domestic Product, Second Quarter 2021

A report by the Beureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, shows that the 2nd quarter of 2021 has been a bloodbath in terms of loss of income, savings, and increased expenses for the average American.

Personal Income: "Current-dollar personal income decreased $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, or 22.0 percent, in contrast to an increase of $2.33 trillion (revised), or 56.8 percent, in the first quarter of 2021."

Disposable personal income decreased $1.42 trillion, or 26.1 percent, in the second quarter, in contrast to an increase of $2.27 trillion, or 63.7 percent (revised), in the first quarter. - Again all fake gains thru the stimmy.

Real disposable personal income decreased 30.6 percent in Q2, in contrast to an increase of 57.6 percent in Q1. - Again Trump & Biden Bucks.

"Disposable" means that (money considered as non-essential... 🙄) decreased by over $890 billion for Americans in Q2 of 2021 alone.

AT THE SAME TIME, Personal outlays (expenses) increased $680.8 billion in Q2, *after already having increased* $538.8 billion in Q1.

- This means that expenses have increased by $150+ Billion in average from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021 for Americans! Can you say hyper-inflation?

Personal savings was $1.97 trillion in the second quarter, compared with $4.07 trillion in the first quarter of 2021

The personal saving rate---personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income---was DOWN 10.9 % in the second quarter, which was *already DOWN* 20.8 % in the first quarter.

This means Americans have lost $2+ TRILLION in savings, Q2 2021 ALONE.

Where does it go? Banks and lenders?

Inflation seems to be the only thing that's going up this quarter.

"The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent (revised) in the first quarter... The PCE price index increased 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the 1st quarter.

The acceleration in real GDP growth reflects artificial economic strength.

5/1/2021 - Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, on GDP and the Economy for Q1 2021 (currently the most recent)

**"**The GDP is primarily based in the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as government assistance payments were distributed to households and businesses. An acceleration in consumer spending and upturns in federal as well as state and local government spending more than accounted for the acceleration in real GDP.

These were partly offset by downturns in private inventory investment and exports and by decelerations in residential fixed investment and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports slowed."

The US Economy by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis says;

"The acceleration in consumer spending reflected an upturn in spending on goods and an acceleration in spending on services.

Within goods, all components of both durable and nondurable goods contributed to the upturn. The leading contributors were upturns in spending on motor vehicles and parts as well as on food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption.

Within services, the leading contributors to the acceleration were upturns in spending on food services and accommodations and on transportation services.

An upturn in federal government spending was the second largest contributor to the acceleration in real GDP. The upturn primarily reflected an upturn in nondefense spending on intermediate goods and services purchased by government. In the first quarter, the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government added approximately $13.2 billion ($52.6 billion at an annual rate) to nondefense services. Federal government purchases of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to the public contributed to the upturn in nondefense goods.

The upturn in state and local government spending reflected an upturn in consumption expenditures, led by *compensation of employees*, that was partly offset by a downturn in gross investment, led by a downturn in structures.

The downturn in private inventory investment was led by a larger decrease in retail trade and a downturn in manufacturing. Within retail trade, the largest contributor was a larger decrease in inventory investment by motor vehicle dealers. Within manufacturing, there were downturns in both durable and nondurable goods manufacturing inventory investment.

The downturn in exports reflected downturns in both goods (led by a deceleration in industrial supplies and a downturn in foods, feeds, and beverages) and services (led by a deceleration in transport and a downturn in royalties and license fees).

Residential fixed investment slowed, largely reflecting a slowdown in new residential structures, notably single-family units, and a downturn in brokers' commissions.

Nonresidential fixed investment slowed, reflecting a slowdown in investment in equipment that was partly offset by a smaller decrease in investment in structures. Investment in intellectual property products grew at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter.

The slowdown in equipment investment was more than accounted for by a slowdown in transportation equipment that was partly offset by an acceleration in information processing equipment.

Imports slowed. As a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, imports contributed to the acceleration in first-quarter GDP. The main contributor was a downturn in automotive vehicles, engines, and parts." -end quote

Can you say they're taking our jobs overseas? Reducing lending to home buyers because there are no home buyers qualified looking to buy BECAUSE OF THEIR CURRENT FINANCIAL STATE OF SAVINGS $$ ? Many people spent a lot of their stimulus on cars and food, and now all of that artificial growth is gone reflected by the downturn in imports and exports which are directly correlated to the lack of funds in American's bank accounts.

They NEED COVID spending to prop up the GDP, the market, the USD and it's too far gone.

Without COVID one could think they may have already defaulted previously, as an after-thought.

P.S. I'm not anti-vax or anything like that.

Part 3 of 7

July 21, 2021 - CBO released report:

"Additional Information About the Updated Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031"

"As the pandemic eases and demand for consumer services surges, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in CBO's projections grows by 7.4 percent this year and surpasses its potential (maximum sustainable) level by the end of the year."

A market crash is insinuated by CBO and they directly state that the GDP of this nation surpassing maximum sustainability, if the pandemic doesn't ease up and consumers start spending more on services again.

But American's can't spend more on services because of low savings $ the likes of which hasn't been seen in many years!!

And we all know Delta variant numbers are up as of today, even for certain famous vaccinated individuals in the news right now.

<https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57263>

Meanwhile, CBO claims unemployment will decrease....

"Employment grows quickly in the second half of 2021 in CBO's projections and surpasses its prepandemic level in mid-2022. Inflation rises in 2021 to its highest rate since 2008 as increases in the supply of goods and services lag behind increases in the demand for them. By 2022, supply adjusts more quickly, and inflation falls but remains above its prepandemic rate through 2025. As the economy continues to expand over the forecast period, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes rises, reaching 2.7 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2031---still low by historical standards."

But unemployment hasn't decreased at all lately.

7/21/2021 - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released report states, "The national unemployment rate, 5.9 percent, was little changed over the month."

- Nine states have an unemployment rate of over 7% and in several states is as high as 7.9 % as of 8/4/21.

Part 4 of 7

The Debt Ceiling Dilemma

"A two-year deal to suspend the debt ceiling lapsed at midnight (7/31/21) following inaction from Congress and President Biden to give the U.S. more borrowing authority. The Treasury Department will now begin taking what it refers to as "extraordinary measures" to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt."

"Republican leaders have told Democrats that there can be no bipartisan debt ceiling agreement without a slate of debt reduction measures targeting the roughly $28 trillion national debt. Several GOP lawmakers have floated a deal similar to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which ended a debt ceiling standoff shortly before the U.S. suffered its first ever credit downgrade."

"Democrats, however, argue that tying a debt ceiling increase to any controversial legislation is akin to holding the financial system hostage. Without help from Republicans, Democrats would have to approve a debt ceiling hike through a budget reconciliation measure, which only needs a simple majority to pass in each chamber but would require support from all 50 Senate"

- Do you think all 50 Democrats are going to agree ????

IN JUNE, CBO estimated that Congress likely had until October or November before the Treasury Department exhausts its extraordinary measures and the ability to pay government bills on time.

Back in June, the estimate was Oct or Nov....

In the most recent July 21, 2021 report, both CBO and Treasury have "warned that the U.S. could be on the verge of default soon after lawmakers return" from a planned summer recess in September, when they will face a time crunch on passing legislation to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1.

CBO says, "the Treasury would probably run out of cash sometime in the first quarter of the next fiscal year (which begins on October 1, 2021, most likely in October or November, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both."

The timing and size of revenue collections and outlays over the coming months could differ noticeably from CBO's projections. Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, either earlier or later than CBO projects.

Yellen has also said, "uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's fiscal response has made it harder to pin down exactly how long the U.S. to avoid a default."

Yellen states, the US could run out of money using "extraordinary measures" by September, "soon after Congress returns from recess", which means the USA could possibly default on it's debt for the first time in history.

This means we could see the US Treasury's ability to pay almost all bills completely crippled well before or after Congress' return to duty as they just began a 6 week vacation on 7/31/21.

8/3/2021

Only 6% of all money provided by the US Government for rent relief has been sent out to Americans as of 8/3/2021.

-If the gov't shuts down, how will the rest be sent, and it's moving at a snails pace already. How long can you afford to pay your tenant's rent (your mortgage) and your own home's mortgage before you go bankrupt?

8/3/2021

Biden makes national TV statement that the eviction moratorium will be extended until expiration date of October 3rd, 2021. This is according to many illegal, and unconstitutional, because the CDC isn't a regulatory body.

Addendum: 8/4/21

Bought my home in January for asking price. I went to my local non-major bank to open new accounts today to close out my BofA accounts. They offered me a line of credit for $50k without having to fill out any additional paperwork. I spent 1.5 hours talking with the Bank Manager and Head Banker today who told me, "The entire housing market changed starting August. There was 0 showings in town this weekend." And I realized at that moment, the house kiddie korner to me has been for sale for 2-3 months now. The first weekend there were dozens of cars to see it. Then each weekend less. Two weeks ago, I saw 1 family view the home. This past weekend I was home Fri-Sun and no one came to see the house.

Damn...

8/10/2021: United States Senate passes infrastructure bill, but will need to be voted on by Congress when they return September 20, 2021. All 50 Democrats need to agree to pass. Republicans leader strongly oppose as of this writing.

The end of the fiscal year is the last day of September, and this could possibly cause a government shutdown as of 12:00 AM Eastern on October 1st, 2021.

Our GDP is a complete farce that was being held up by stimulus payments, government covid spending, Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements of Treasury Bills to the tune of now over $1 Trillion per day, imports and exports are down huge while sea ports are more severely congested than ever before as are airline cargo carriers. Mortgage applications, sales, and broker commissions are down heavily, trucking rates are at all time highs with minimal availability especially for ocean and rail drayage, warehouse storage for said freight is at maximum capacity with available space at all time lows & prices at all time highs due to supply and demand, retail trade and manufacturing are down significantly in Q2. Consumer spending is down as well as savings to lows not seen in many years.

Essentially the bubble from stimulus has already been popped. It's only a short matter of time before we see the effects on our country, and it will be reflected on the stock market and American's bank accounts first and foremost, as it is already being seen by the banks unwillingness to invest in long term stocks/bonds/treasuries using the record high $1 Trillion per day Repurchase / Reverse Program to prevent the dollar and market from collapsing together.

<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD>

A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office analyzing the 2013 debt ceiling standoff found that "investors reported taking the unprecedented action of systematically avoiding certain *Treasury securities*," which are considered almost as safe as cash, causing widespread issues across credit markets.

"Industry groups emphasized that even a temporary delay in payment could undermine confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States and therefore cause significant damage to markets for Treasury securities and other assets," the report said.

The last 2 times the debt ceiling crisis occurred in 2011 and 2013, rating agencies re-evaluated the rating of US government debt.

On October 15 2013, Fitch Ratings placed the United States under a "Rating watch negative" in response to the crisis.

On October 17 2013, Dagong Global Credit Rating downgraded the United States from A to A-, and maintained a negative outlook on the country's credit.

In 2013 while lawmakers and the Obama Administration came to an agreement on the debt ceiling, from September 19th to October 9th, the S&P 500 moved below its 50 day moving average and the SPY lost 5.2%.

On 8/9/2011, during the Debt Ceiling Crisis The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 634.76 points as approximately $2.5 TRILLION was erased from global equities.

$ 2,500,000,000,000.00 in *1 day***.**

The S&P 500 Index lost 6.7 percent to 1,119.46, its lowest level since September, as all 500 stocks fell for the first time since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1996.

7/30/21 -Federal Reserve announced commercial bank asset and LIABILITY numbers release H8

The Liabilities have grown big time since last year.

Federal Reserve released COMMERCIAL BANK ASSET & LIABILITIES numbers for July 2021 show year over year losses have increased tremendously in the 100's of trillions of dollars, a large majority of this is based on derivatives, options calls/puts, mortgage back securities, swaps of all kinds, rehypothecated shares, naked shorts, synthetic shares up the ass...

Naked and Synthetic shorts are NEVER REPORTED until hedge funds and market makers need to buy them back via a squeeze or NFT token dividend, or cash dividend !!!!

See screenshot for explanation of subsection 22 losses description w/ yellow markings.

<https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/>

All of the 11 Tables provided shows an increase of losses.

The only table pictured is TABLE 2 showing an increase of $15,687,000,000 Trillion in UNREALIZED LOSSES IN derivatives, securities, swaps, etc...$ 15,687,000,000 in 1 year only Table 2 of 11....

On Table 2 (of 11) alone, their *RESIDUAL Assets* (less liabilities) <*minus expenses*> increased only $40 Billion compared to the $1.54 Trillion increase in losses. Other assets have grown at a much lower rate than the percentage gain of losses, as well.

So even though they had huge increases in revenue (covid stimulus), the net gain was hugely diminished by the losses in these sectors.

6/28/2021

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released report stated,

> "4 large banks held 89 percent of the total banking industry notional amount of derivatives, out of a total of 1,385 insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations," that held derivatives at the end of first quarter 2021.

JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs.

OCC also said;

"Additionally, derivatives contracts remained concentrated in interest rate products, which represented 72.7 percent of total derivative notional amounts.The percentage of centrally cleared derivatives transactions increased quarter-over-quarter to 38.2 percent in first quarter 2021."

THIS MEANS 61.8 % OF ALL THEIR VOLUME IS BEING TRADED ON FUCKING DARK POOLS !

YOU SONS OF A...

[Viewpoint.com](https://viewpoint.com/) says,

> "Centrally-cleared derivatives are negotiated between the counterparties but contain standardized terms and are traded through a central clearing house. ...

Part 7 of 7

Sadly, many Americans will lose their homes, businesses, savings, 401ks, likely more so than in 2008.

Could this lead to the collapse of the dollar if the government defaults on it's debt for the first time, possibly the collapse or rise of crypto, war with China, issues with the middle east, blackrock and corporation takeover of land and housing...

I don't know what will happen but if you find this information valuable, please share. I think liquidity will dry up to the point where market makers, broker dealers, prime brokers, hedge funds, and banks aren't going to be able to cover their liabilities, and the DTCC, NSCC, SEC, and FINRA have been enacting hundreds of new filings over the last few months because their $100 Trillion dollar insurance policy could potentially be hit hard.

-Lastly, a poem , SAY IT LOUD AND PROUD IF YOU'RE AN APE !!!

I ain't sellin' till they fire Janet Yellin

I'm holdin' until Citadel foldin'

I ain't through until they liquidate point 72

I'll keep on goin' until they jail Steve Cohen

I'll not get rid, until the SEC finds the FTD's they've hid

I'll not sell til I reach my floor, until then, the world must know that our governments are bought and paid for

Until that price is rippin', I'll know there's still a lifeline for Kenny Griffin

I'll be staying long until they admit the price is wrong

I won't liquidate until the SEC stops using work time to masturbate

I'll not make a toast until I receive a flying bed post

And when it's all done and I'm rewarded for having waited, I'll use my tendies to make Chicago sophisticated
