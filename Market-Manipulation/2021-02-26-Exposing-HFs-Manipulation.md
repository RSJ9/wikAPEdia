Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!

First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.

Now the juicy stuff; What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:

9:35 AM: The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.

9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that

1:55PM: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)

2PM TO 3:25PM: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.

3:30PM TO 4:00PM: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.

NOW THE ANALYSIS:

WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?

So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday: EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY! (<https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme>; <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME>) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?

Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.

WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?

Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.

WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?

Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.

IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!

TL;DR: Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!

EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME): According to this site (<http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME>), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!

EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ: <http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit>.

Quote: " Naked Short --- This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation -- the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share --- instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share."

EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME>)

EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares? It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.

EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.

Another edit to blueball you guys even more: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.

UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA. YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.

I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!
