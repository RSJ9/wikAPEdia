V3an update on my previous posts with a dive deeper , with more information and why the squeeze could be being suppressed by the "POWERS THAT BE"

First Check out these DDto Understand how corrupt it has been for years and lots of great reading material to understandthe recent price action through abuse and naked shorting and CONTINUIOUS NET SETTLEMENT SYSTEM .

The Greedy Monster

decades of abuse and loopholes , no punishment , no enforcement .

eventually someone will succumb to immense greed an ruin everything. DTCC/sec was aware for many years the loopholes being abused and nothing was took seriously .

eventually rules were put in place to stop some of the corruption only after too much attention did they start to make a change and did not even bother to investigate the corruption.

"¬†The DTC and it's participants have created a market-sized naked short selling scheme. All of this is made possible by the DTC's enrollee- Cede & Co.¬†" - HOUSE OF CARDS P1_______________________________________________________________

I Believe they indirectly created this massive monster by allowing this fuckery to continue for too long which is now out of control and could expose everything they need to protect them selves with these new DTC-2021 rules and they need to divert as much attention from themselves as possible to not reveal the corruption . Sec or DTCC or whoever turns a blind eye and continues to allow the abuse cause THEYRE NOT READY YET .I BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE MOONED ALONG TIME AGO BUT THEY WONT LET IT HAPPEN YET

"What our current system does is to allow trades to "Clear" at warp speed without legally "Settling".¬†[DR BONI's](https://stopnakedshortselling.org/tag/boni/)¬†research clearly showed the "Pervasiveness" and extreme age of the failed deliveries stacking up at the DTCC. This vastly dilutes the "Readily-sellable" share structure of targeted corporations causing their share price to plummet which allows the proceeds from the sale of bogus shares to actually flow into the laps of the fraudsters despite their having absolutely no intent of ever buying or replacing that which they have already sold. Recall that all the fraudsters have to do is to collateralize this ever-diminishing debt on a daily "Market-to-market" basis."

"At the DTCC, it is extremely easy for fraudsters to illegally sell nonexistent shares and actually get their hands on the proceeds without ever covering. PARDON US IF WE INVESTORS FIND THIS CONCEPT TO BE NOT ONLY HEINOUS BUT UNCONSCIONABLE. All these fraudsters need to do is to collateralize the naked short position in a "Marked to market" manner on a daily basis such that the depressant effect on the share price from yet further naked short selling allows the proceeds from previous naked short sales to fall into the lap of the perpetrators of these frauds.¬†The key is to never stop naked short selling which might have the untoward effect of allowing the share price to increase to find its own unmanipulated equilibrium level. The current clearance and settlement system in use at the DTCC allows naked short positions to be run up so rapidly that¬†if the victimized issuer fails to die on cue then the perpetrators of this fraud cannot only not cover these positions without financial collapse but they can't even stop the daily onslaught without risking the share price going up. The allure of free investor money is so overwhelming that prudent short selling practices fall by the wayside"

"¬†Everyone on Wall Street -- the financial press, the brokers, the DTCC/NSCC/DTC, the research firms, the banks -- all have a ton to lose by this being understood by Main Street America."

"they weren't being stupid, they just didnt care"

When Naked shorting fails

In the old days, stock counterfeiting was a matter of using cumbersome paper and ink, and forging signatures. Nowadays, as almost all "stock" is really electronic book-entries kept in the DTC's ledger, it is much easier. And there are numerous ways to achieve the same stock counterfeiting effect.

First, an unscrupulous hedge fund or other large-scale stock manipulator sells some "stock. Second, he fails to deliver it.

In the 3 days between when he sells it, and when he is supposed to deliver it, the buyer's broker will credit the buyer's account with something called a "Securities Entitlement." When the seller fails to deliver the shares on day three, legally, per the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Section 8, the "Securities Entitlement" becomes invalid, and should be removed from the buyer's account.

But because the buyer's broker got paid his commission already, he doesn't want to have to "bust the trade" because of non-delivery (and return the commissions), so he will just keep that now invalid "Securities Entitlement" in the buyer's account, representing it as real and valid.

That is one form of counterfeit stock, as the buyer thinks it is real, and yet it has none of the rights that a real stock has -- voting rights, dividend rights, etc. And the brokers treat these fake, invalid "Securities Entitlements" as real, and will allow the buyer to sell them to the next chump -- they sort of have to allow them to, as they've been representing them as real all along.

Because this practice is not limited to just a few bad brokers, it can be said to be an institutional, or systemic, problem. Everyone on the Wall Street side of the fence wants to treat those fake "Securities Entitlements" as real -- the only ones that lose by the fake, invalid "Securities Entitlements" being in the system are investors, and the companies affected.

For Wall Street it is literally free money.

A valid "Securities Entitlement" ALWAYS has a corresponding book-entry share at the DTC's ledger. A fake, invalid "Securities Entitlement" doesn't -- so it is falsely represented to have the rights of the real thing -- exactly like a counterfeit. Hence the term counterfeit stock.

This first description is the mechanism where naked short selling, or "failing to deliver", can create counterfeit stock.

Yet another method of stock counterfeiting occurs when brokers lend shares from margin accounts, and fail to alert the margin account investors that the "Securities Entitlements" are now NOT backed by the corresponding electronic book-entry anymore, as that book-entry has been lent. Again, these are invalid, fake "Securities Entitlements" per the UCC Sec. 8, and thus counterfeit stock.

"Ex-Clearing" is where the buying broker and the selling broker make a contractual agreement to handle delivery of the shares off-line, outside the system. Nobody polices these arrangements, so there is no way of knowing when, if ever, the shares are delivered -- that is between the two brokers.

This results in share counterfeiting, as the buyer is represented to have received valid "Share Entitlements" when in fact they are nothing of the sort, until the book-entry shares are delivered -- which may never happen.

So share counterfeiting can occur in a number of ways, but always because of the same factors -- the buyer's broker misrepresents invalid "Share Entitlements" as real to his client.

That is why "over-voting" occurs -- there are more "Share Entitlements" at the brokers than there are shares to support them at the DTC, and in order to continue misrepresenting the fakes as real, they have to allow investors to vote those fakes, as though real.

Pretty simple. It is all driven by Wall Street not wanting to have to give back commissions when shares are un-delivered. So a flood of fake "Share Entitlements" -- counterfeit shares -- are traded in the system as real, and as long as all the brokers treat the fakes as though they are real, everyone on the industry side of the fence wins big -- more trades, more commissions, more shares with which to drive down prices for the large, super-important customers of Wall Street -- the hedge funds. That is what is known as creating "liquidity" by creating fake shares. It is pervasive, and the SEC and DTCC refuse to tell anyone exactly how big the problem is, or to divulge the size of the problem by company.

Some manipulators aim to drive a company out of business

All of these manipulative techniques exploit the loopholes that the system has introduced by allowing clearing and settling to be de-linked from one another.

By flooding the market with sales transactions that they know will create a flood of fake "Securities Entitlements" on delivery day, the fraudsters use the system to facilitate their stock manipulations -- they know that buying brokers will not bust the trade, even if they don't deliver the shares, thus they are secure in their scheme -- the system will cover for them. And it does. Buy-ins are unheard of in actual practice, thus a manipulator has no dis-incentive to using this type of manipulation technique.____________________________________________________

yeah¬†[investopedia explaining naked shorts and how its still being done today despite the rules being made to stop it](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)

many rules to stop their many different methods of manipulation¬†<https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2013/nscc/SR-NSCC-2013-13-approval-notice.ashx>¬†but yet it continues ?

YOURE TELLING ME YOU REPRESENT THE INVESTORS?

when a rule was made to "protect investors" from the abuse in the system they didn't allow them to solve it by removing the shares from the possession of DTCC/CEDE to stop abuse, they instead passed some "rule" to "Protect investors"

to quote Again from atobit DD HOC

" They not only prevented the issuers from removing their deposits, they also turned a 'blind-eye' to their participants manipulative short selling, even when there's public evidence of them doing so...

....Those companies were being attacked with shares THEY put in the DTC, by institutions they can't even identify.."

Dr Frankenstein's monster

well look what fucking shit they created . how much damage will this cause ?

behind the scenes this monster is probably finding new illegal/loopholes to use cause they know they can and also they know how fucked they are they don't care about legality anymore they're backed into corner with no way out and we are closing in .

could they be using bond shorts to keep the act going longer ?

could they have been looking for more funds and decide to pump some crypto nobody has heard of ?

So far the diversion from DTCC is working ,they need to stay in charge ,whats this talk about moving to crypto based market ?

they will die at the hands of their own monster.

And when the mob comes for their tendies ,the monster will lead us straight to the creator .

the closer we get to exposing them and bringing attention to them the more pressure we add to the squeeze.

BUT HOW YOU ASK ??????

going by the timing of previous rule changes SEC/DTC

*they finally do something about it when their is to much attention*

remember how close we got the first time and they started proposing all these rule changes?

maybe they might pass that DTC-2021-801 or what ever the fuck it is we are waiting for sooner than we think

________________________________________________________________________

this does not mean the squeeze can never happen .it only suggest this is why nothing has happened yet and how its all connected

the cure remains the same as always

HODL

as long as we hold the chances of a FORMIDABLE CATALYST increases . A catalyst which can not be avoided or suppressed . The "EXPOSURE" CATYLST

ANYWAY, sorry for the shitty formatting . but the info must be spread

love yah apes

Don't get it ? Somethings Wrong ? let me know , Lets talk about it and lets dive deeper together

This is not financial Advice . I have a disorder and cant even read

TOO APE DIDNT READ ;

market has been fucked for decades . thanks to the loopholes and and exploits with DTCC/CEDE

and now DTCC is trying to save themselves and draw away attention from the real problem

SHITADEL /KG = the GREEDY MONSTER

Through naked shorting and abuse with loopholes and the Continuous Net Settlement systemthey tried to take down GME and continue to Fight us with Any loophole/Illegal activity they can.

and could possibly be shorting bonds as well as per Atobitts The everything short
