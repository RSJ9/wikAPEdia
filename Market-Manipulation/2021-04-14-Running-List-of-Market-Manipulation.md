Sup Apes,

We need to be prepared now, more than ever, for blatant manipulation tactics. This will not be a smooth run to the top. It will be a battle. The good news is, we've got receipts, and we've gotÂ [their playbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnjqpw/dont_forget_what_they_did_a_running_list_of_fud/).

Below is a running list of all of the blatant examples of market manipulation. There is a bit of overlap here with FUD but my intent is to have a timeline of manipulation around key dates: The January squeeze, the February rally, March 19th Quadruple witching, March Earnings call, etc.

I'm looking specifically for hard data or analysis of charts, and want to keep this as factual as possible. Please go ahead and add any examples I missed in the comments and I'll keep this updated.
