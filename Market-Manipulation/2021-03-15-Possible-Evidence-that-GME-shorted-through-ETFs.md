Listen, I am as dense as a jungle bush when it comes to stock market. But I noticed a few things, most likely others did too. To anyone that wants to do some DD: I think it's quite clear they used ETF's to short GME again, which are not on the SSR list. In other words, they are shorting ETFs to bypass SSR.

I just took a glance at some of the known ETFs that hedgies are known to have shorted. Notice the EOW amount of shares available and the ones that appeared available this monday morning on the market open:

<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IJR>? - IJR, 900k available EOW, 500k available monday morning

<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/VIOG>? - VIOG, 9k available EOW, 2k available monday morning

<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT>? - XRT, 1.3MM available EOW, 850k available monday morning

<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GAMR> - GAMR, 15k available EOW, 3k available monday morning

<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RETL> - RETL, 20k available EOW, 800 available monday morning

<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IWM> - IWM, 6.5MM available EOW, 4MM available monday morning

<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IJS> - IJS, 500k available EOW, 300k available monday morning

Notice how on most of these the shares start returning at 9:45. To my smoothbrain this sort of coordination reeks of something fucky at play. There are more timeframes that these things happen if you look further down the history.

These are just a few that I checked out. There's most certainly more ETFs that follow this pattern. I ask for any smarter ape out there to explain this action rationally to me like I was just born or for someone to do further digging on this.

Edit: 9:45 is also around the timeframe when GME started dipping. They seem to have used multiple ETFs to switch between and keep a constant sell pressure on GME without needing to borrow from GME directly. Most ETFs also have a lower interest rate.

Edit 2: This might also be what DFV was referring to in his 'Ridin' dirty' tweet.

Edit 3: Seems like the cat's out of the bag. [Just look at these perfectly aligning graphs between XRT and GME!](https://i.imgur.com/I9wnEgi.jpg) Thanks [u/MurrE1310](https://www.reddit.com/u/MurrE1310/) for sharing!
