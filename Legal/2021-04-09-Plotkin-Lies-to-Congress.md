Ummm does anyone else remember Gabe P Saying to congress he covered his short position back in Feb? Should we be contacting Congresswoman Maxine Waters about this news today? I bet some wrinkle brain out there can calculate the gains and LOSSES Melvin has been reporting match up perfectly with the rises and falls of GME's share price. What do you say we try and get Gabe P back in front of the House finance committee?

I'll leave this here:

EDIT 5:

Okay so I went back and rewatched everything Gabe said back in Feb during the first hearing. Here is what I could identify as important.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfEuNHVPc_k&t=17423s>

00:19:57

Gabe goes under oath

00:30:00

Gabe begins his opening statement..."in fact Melvin closed out all of it's positions in gamestop days before the platforms put those limitations in place." (Can some ape dig through the data and see if we can prove that to be a lie? If it were true we would have mooned back in Jan. All that happened in Jan was a Gamma Squeeze which I understand is driven by call options etc... not covered shorts. Solid evidence here would be nice.)

00:34:06

"In the frenzy during January Gamestop stock rose from $17 to a peak of $483...... When this frenzy began Melvin started closing out it's position on Gamestop at a loss. (Notice him looking up at a lawyer just off camera lol)

01:43:13

Rep Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-3) "Mr. Plotkin you made the comment in your testimony a minute ago that you were not trying to manipulate stock. Yet if your short selling a stock 140% um for me on the outside looking in, it looks like that's exactly what you're doing. Explain to me why that's not manipulating the stock?"

Gabe..."Thank you congressman um for us. I can't speak to other people that were short. Any time we short a stock we locate a borrow. Our systems actually forces us to find a borrow so we always you know short stocks within the context of all the rules."

01:53:36

Gabe..."We run a long short portfolio, the majority of our investments are long investments, but we also have short investments to hedge out market risk."

03:43:12

Gabe...."Umm look I think to some degree markets are self correcting. You know moving forward stocks. I don't think you're going to see stocks with the kind of short interest levels that we saw prior to this year. I don't think investors like myself want to be susceptible to these type of dynamics. (Aren't you only susceptible because the SI is 140%? which implies naked shorts. If they still bleeding then those shorts ain't covered) I think there will be a lot closer monitoring of message boards...." (Hi shills.)

04:54:41

Gabe..."Yeah, hi ahh thank you for the question. you know I, I think ah, I mean I don't have the exact answer to your question. I do think it's worth noting that, you know as the stock price moved higher, you know, there was a three day period where it traded almost 11 times the entire float and so I think that kind of volume gave anyone who was short ample opportunity to cover and probably suggests tremendous either frenzy buying or institutional buying or some sort of combination. We did look at some of the options activity in the stock and you know on friday January 22nd there was options that were expiring that would have equated to 35 to 45 million shares of stock ownership. So I actually don't think the short covering was the biggest driver of the stock. When you kind of look at the volume I kind of think the biggest driver was the aggressive options activity, Umm and then wether it was institutional or retail, just the collective buying."

okay interpret what you will and do as you want. Hope this helps Apes.

EDIT 1: Gabe stated in his testimony that they closed all their gme position.

EDIT 2: Here is a list of all the members of the¬†[U.S.House Committee on Financial Services](https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm). If one of them is your congress person pick up the phone and give them a call. They don't read emails.

<https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm>

EDIT 3: Is there a wrinkle brain out there who knows how to calculate the reported losses against the GME share price? Being able to show a correlation would be nice. A clean graph or something might make getting congress on board easier.

EDIT 4: Wow apes thank you so much for the awards. Seems like the community likes this idea.

1st: Okay well in my opinion getting congress to act takes a lot of consistent PUBLIC pressure. I've listed the congress people in the committee, take some time and do a little DD if one of them represents you. You'll want to find the phone # for both their Washington office as well as there local state office. Congress people travel back and forth a lot so you want to hit them in both places. You will likely just speak to an aid (that's okay) so leave a message with them and follow up a few days later to make sure your message reached them.

2nd: Some news coverage would help, but I like you don't trust the MSM. However there might be one exception. The Hill.

As you can see from these examples they have understood and sympathized with us since back in January:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atHMYQtunF0&t=483s>

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTT4it_f7Jc>

If we could get them to call this out in one of their segments that would apply a ton of pressure on the House Finance committee to act,

Here is there twitter info:

Go forth ape army and make some noise!

EDIT 6: This is not legal or financial advise. You can do whatever you want. I'm just organizing information in one spot so people can do what they believe is right.

EDIT 7: This is what I mean can we some how use math to prove Melvin never covered in Jan and thus lied in Feb during the hearing?¬†[u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/)¬†Got any wrinkles for us? lmao. How about¬†[u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/)¬†?

"It makes perfect sense. They doubled down and shorted on the way down in Jan. This resulted in 20% gain (from their all time low) in Feb. Now the stock is up 400% from feb, and they're down 50%.

Another 2x would be in the $400-$500 range which aligns with the last peak and the expectations of where the margin calls begin."

EDIT 8: Some wisdom from the past

"In this age, in this country, public sentiment is everything. With it, nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed. Whoever molds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces judicial decisions."

--¬†Abraham Lincoln

EDIT 9: 13F filing on 5/17 could shed some light on this.

Credit goes to: u/[Ok_Entrepreneur_5833](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Entrepreneur_5833/)

"Well I mean that's public knowledge, although it isn't updated often enough and hopefully one day will be as a result of all this since we (apes) demand transparency going forward.

<https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/gamestop%20corp/1326380/>

This is the latest we have. So when they update the 13F filing again, which is 5/17 we'll know one way or the other. Until then we will not know."

EDIT 10: Can't seem to cross post to¬†[r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)¬†Maybe I don't have enough karma? Would someone being willing to cross post this for me? open up the debate to a bigger community?

EDIT 11: This is the way.

"You lot are like the government going after Al Capone.. fine we can't get you on murder, extortion and rackets so will find something. Boom! Tax evasion! Except this time its lying under oath."

EDIT 12: Why should we bring congress into the picture? PROS/CONS list

PROS

HF have to pay for lawyers, draining them of financial resources that would otherwise be used to delay the MOASS or short attack us.

Public pressure and transparence makes DTCC nervous and they Margin Call Melvin and friends.

News coverage triggers FOMO which increase size of Ape army and triggers MOASS

Congress realizes how much TAX revenue the MOASS will generate and what that would mean for their own re-election effort. They pressure the SEC, the SEC fines Melvin and friend further draining their resources and increasing the speed at which we reach MOASS.

Our collective knowledge after having gone through this these past months is made public and is used to reform the markets in a way that makes them fairer for retail.

The complete corruption that is the SEC becomes obvious and triggers calls for a reform of the organization itself.

The House Committee on Finance decides to make an example of Gabe to help them look good in the eyes of voters (because they hold the smallest of majorities in both house and senate) and they follow through and charge him with perjury like they did to Michael cohen and we all get to watch Gabe P marched off in hand cuffs while we collect our tendies.

Nothing happens except Kenny G and Gabe P shit themselves harder than they already have been.

CONS

Congress does nothing and we're back where we started.

The parties decide to take sides and this becomes a partisan issue (If we didn't have one party in control of the house, senate and white this might be a serious issue to consider, but in my opinion under the current conditions this wouldn't amount to more then a few 24 hour news cycles on the cable channels. Which would create some FOMO which I still consider a plus. Who doesn't want more Apes?)

This Galvanizes the other HF and they unit behind Melvin and citadel to crush us and remove us a threat. (If that were going to happen I believe it already would have. I don't think these HF like each other very much. Many of them might be applauding the financial death of a serious rival. Just my take.)

CNBC gets mad and starts coming after us even more than they have already. (Bring it Cramer, I ain't afraid of your bald ass.)

EDIT 13: So every indication I've seen about the Jan pop was that it was a Gamma Squeeze. My understanding is that a Gamma Squeeze is driven by call options and high volume. If Melvin had honestly covered or "closed" in any way we would have mooned. All the DD I've read points to them reseting FTDs (which maybe could be argued that means it was closed) and doubling then tripling down to shake paper hands and push us down to $40 in Feb. This idea the Gabe P did cover and wasn't lying then for some dumb ass reason decided to re-short GME after the hearing I think is silly. Why walk back into a trap that you escaped and or passed off the citadel?

Oc-cam's ra-zor/Àå√§k…ômz ÀàrƒÅz…ôr/*noun*

1.  the principle (attributed to William of Occam) that in explaining a thing no more assumptions should be made than are necessary. The principle is often invoked to defend reductionism or nominalism.

The simplest answer is that he lied because he was trying to bluff us at the time and was hoping we would paper hand and walk away, we didn't. If we had no one would have bother to look deeper and call him on his BS.

EDIT 14: CLOSED VS COVERED

okay there is a growing feeling in the community that thanks to his lawyers most likely; Gabe said 'Closed' not 'covered' and thus this will somehow let him loop hole his way out.

So? Shouldn't he clarify that under oath? They're toying with our economy/our lives like it means nothing. They kill business we love just so they don't have to pay taxes on their investments. They crashed the world economy in 2008 and as we have all come to see they are preparing to do it again with US treasury bonds. They bring no value to society. Like a tick the just suck resources out of us so they can buy absurd apartments in the sky to better look down on the rest of us. I want them answering question in front of congress everyday. But then that's you know, like my opinion man. and this is just a "Discussion" as the flair so clearly displays.

EDIT 15: CONGRESSIONAL INCOMPETENCE AND THE CYNICAL PERSPECTIVE

Is congress filled with idiots? ///Yes, but even idiots know how to work to their own self interest. So we make it in their own self interest. Also Congress is filled with Human beings that juggle multiple committee jobs on top of the local stuff in their state. They only have soo much attention to give to any particular issue or topic. -- For example -- those of you who watch Andrew Mo Money probably are aware that he just got an interview with Congressman Ro Khanna. Andrew was smart enough to bring the man the myth the legend¬†[u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/)¬†with him. Watch the video and see how the congressman react to¬†[u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/)¬†questions and comments. He had no idea what was going on or how massive it was. (He also look exhausted as fuck probably did this after some four hour long kabuki theater routine on some committee he came off of) If congress isn't acting they way you want it might be as simple as their just to busy and or ignorant to whats going on beneath the surface. Admit it, you had no idea either until you found this beautiful community of apes to explain it to you. Maybe we should take the community and it's knowledge to them? Food for thought.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKnXneFUbxU&t=3s>

Is congress on our side? ///Depends on the context. If they can benefit from something they WILL consider it. It all flows back to how the general public with feel about it. Sentiment is key. This community and others like it have a pretty galvanized sentiment on what's happening with GME and why and last I checked there were 9.8 million apes on WSB.

Will Congress protect Gabe P and Kenny G? ///Congress has plenty of lobbyist kissing their collective asses. They don't NEED Melvin or Citadel for anything really because they are easily replaceable by another HF that wasn't stupid enough to take on Reddit.

What if I don't like the party in charge? ///You don't need to agree with a politician in order to compel them with speech. It's literally their job to listen to their constituents wether they voted for them or not. Never forget that they are our employees, our taxes pay there bills. We don't care what's convenient for them only that they do their job and act to improve our way of life and preserve the American Dream.

How do we make it in congresses self interest? ///Call them and explain what you know. Synthetic shares and all. Remind them you are their constituent and that mid terms are fast approaching. One bad race could tip the scales of congress in a way they wouldn't like if they were seen to be on the side of HF and not a voter. Explain the 'Everything Short' and the threat of a 2008 repeat while on their watch. EXPLAIN IN DETAIL THE MOASS AND JUST HOW MUCH TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD GENERATE. who knows if you do a good job they might just go out and buy some GME themselves.

Wouldn't it be naive to trust such a corrupt organization as congress? ///The good thing about corrupt organizations is the lack of loyalty. Just ask the FBI, turning one mobster against another sometimes is pretty easy. HF haven't done themselves any favors and it is a huge political risk for politicians to be 'openly' associated with them. The fact that there are only a few HF who have been caught in our diamond handed trap means the vast majority of other HF and MM will go on uninterrupted. Again Melvin and Citadel are replacable and politicians what and need to be on TV to build their own self serving profile in the eyes of the public. Even a corrupt man can be made to do the right thing so long as there is some kind of benefit.

OKAY I'LL END THIS EDIT WITH ANOTHER FAMOUS QUOTE

'Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time....'

Winston S Churchill, 11 November 1947

EDIT 16: FAMOUS APES WALK AMONG US

credit to¬†[u/buttfarm69](https://www.reddit.com/u/buttfarm69/)

"Completely agree. I think the problem is just that the information we have isn't reaching the people who can make legislative changes, or they aren't looking. We've got a lot of obstacles working against us so I am not confident that we will see jail time for these fuckers until many years from now once all the underlying pieces come to light. I just hope that the market mechanics work as intended because we are due our tendies."

EDIT 17: QUOTES FOR DAYS

Alexey Navalny

(The only guy with balls bigger than DFV. After Putin failed to kill him with poison he flew back to russia just to show he wouldn't be scared off. This is what he said in court as he was being charged with a made up crime.)

"The government and the system are trying to tell those people, "you're alone." The government's task is to scare you and then persuade you that you are alone. It's important not to feel lonely, because if I were Voldemort, I would like you to feel lonely. Obviously our Voldemort (Putin) in his palace also wants it. As another outstanding philosopher of our times, Rick Sanchez (from"Rick and Morty") said, "to live is to risk it all. If you don't risk, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you." Just imagine how wonderful life would be without constant lying. Imagine how great it would be to work as a judge when a phone call justice doesn't exist, no one calls you, and you're just a cool judge with a big salary, bigger than you have now, you're a respected pillar of the society, no one would be able to call you and give you directions about what verdict to issue....We are a very unhappy country and we can't get out of this vicious circle of unhappiness. But we want it so much. That's why I suggest we change a slogan and we don't just say that "Russia has to be free." but also that "Russia has to be happy." Russia will be happy. I'm done."

For the pessimists out there who think action from congress is unlikely. How likely did you think the MOASS was back in NOV or DEC? Look where things are now? Just cause something is unlikely doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
