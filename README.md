### Do your part!
- [Shorts may be borrowing your shares to short-sell them and drive the price down. Make sure you change settings and call your broker to OPT-OUT0(https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/)

- [Stop using brokers that halted trading - List of good, neutral (forced), and bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/)

-If you are stuck on one of these brokers, I recommend you call up another broker to check whether you would be allowed to sell during the transfer process. I am in the middle of a transfer and the receiving broker informed me that there will only be 2 days where I cannot sell (called the settlement cycle days) and normally takes a week to sell a common company stock from NYSE
