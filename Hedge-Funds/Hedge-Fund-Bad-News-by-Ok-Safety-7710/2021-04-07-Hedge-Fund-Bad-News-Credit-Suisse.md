I hope everyone is having a great day and has had a chance to cool down after the past couple of days events. I know I needed to. So, finally I make it to Credit Suisse.

6\. this is not not financial or investment advice

Now on to the main dish, Credit Suisse.

Who are they?

Credit Suisse Group AGÂ is a global wealth manager,Â [investment bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking)Â andÂ [financial services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services)Â firm\
founded and based inÂ [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland). Headquartered inÂ [ZÃ¼rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich), it maintains offices in allÂ [major financial centersÂ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre)around the world and is one of the nine global "[Bulge Bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_Bracket)" banks providing services inÂ [investment banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_bank),Â [private banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_banking),Â [asset management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management), andÂ [shared services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_services). Credit Suisse is known for its strictÂ [bank--client confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_secrecy)Â andÂ [banking secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_Switzerland)Â practices. It is considered aÂ [systematically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution)Â by theÂ [Financial Stability Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Stability_Board).Â [Credit Suisse Wikipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse)

Who are the Executives?

Now isn't that the million dollar question. Currently all of the executives are departing as a result of the Archegos losses. Do we know the situation exactly...meh, not really. This could all be for show.

[CNBC Credit Suisse Execs Depart as Bank Details Archegos Loss](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/05/credit-suisse-investment-bank-head-chief-risk-officer-to-depart-sources-say.html)Â Don't worry I double checked with an additional sources[(Stop Naked Short Selling) People Moves: Facing the Funds Fallout Music, CS Changes, and More](https://stopnakedshortselling.org/2021/04/article-people-moves-facing-the-funds-fallout-music-cs-changes-chairs-and-more/)Â to confirm. Here is the link:Â [The Economic Times - English Edition, Two Credit Suisse Executives to Depart As Bank Details Archegos Losses; Report](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/credit-suisse-executives-to-depart-as-bank-details-archegos-losses-report/articleshow/81923415.cms)Â CNBC is pretty Vague. This article gives the name and ranks of those departing and defines how many. CRO Lara Warner and CEO Brian Chin are leaving. New executives are already being named and placed. Christian Meissner will replace Chin at the beginning of May. Joachim Oechslin is the newly appointed interim CRO - effective immediately.

TL;TA;DR

Credit Suisse has a long history of market rigging , Fraud and manipulation. They can't seem to get their heads on Straight at all. Just plain Dumb and Thieves in the market. Have had fines issued in the United States and Abroad.

Recap of Previous HFBN:

GoldmanÂ is shady as fuck and doesn't care about getting caught. CEO is an asshole.

UBSÂ reads like a criminal rap sheet. You got money laundering, currency manipulation, market manipulation, libor manipulation, spoofing, collusion, insider trading. I didn't even have to go outsideÂ [stopnakedshortselling.org](https://stopnakedshortselling.org/). UBS has 15, that's right FIFTEEN PAGES! UBS IS THE Megalodon shark among the White Tip and Nurse Sharks.

****UBS Group AG has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (GME) in the form of stock options. The firm currently holds 92,200 call options valued at $1,737,000 USD and 3,815,800 put options valued at $71,890,000 USD .Â <https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/ubs>

Recap: Citadel

Has gotten in trouble for using dark pools to manipulate the prices the stocks, has alleged ties to a coup taking over the Illinois state government, has previously been fined for market manipulations. Additionally, poaches staff from other hedge funds. Citadel has sued the SEC and the IEX president over a new method of order flow D-Limit. Ken Griffin also fires 10% of his employees every month for underperforming. Has a single piece of art that can cover the amount on money needed to pay shareholders in a squeeze. (Links to be provide at end - posted in another post, before starting the sort of daily hedge fund bad news began). Has a really good PR team. - Buys the rights to all the images of him, and tries their best to keep his personal life out of the press. Moreover, is skimming off the top of all trades that go through on PFOF. Bad Blood Between Citadel, SEC and other Hedge Funds.

Recap: Point 72's Steve Cohen

Been Fined and convicted of insider trading and failing to supervise staff engaged in insider trading. Has just recently come off a 4 year trading Freeze in china, has been sued for gender discrimination. got his ex-wife's fraud case against him dismissed, point72/Cohen has a long list of felonies. Cohen has even had a 2 year ban for trading for "failure to Supervise" assessed by the SEC and also paid them 135,000,000 fine. Has an Art Collection that can more than pay for squeeze.

Recap: Two Sigma, John Overdeck & David Seigel:

Basically decent human beings who got caught up in a bad trade. Still has a lot of put options on GME.
