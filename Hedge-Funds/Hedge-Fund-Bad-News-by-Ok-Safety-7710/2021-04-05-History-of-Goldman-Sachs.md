Who/What is Goldman Sachs?

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs>

Goldman Sachs was founded in New York City in 1869 by [Marcus Goldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Goldman).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-11) In 1882, Goldman's son-in-law [Samuel Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Sachs) joined the firm.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-13) In 1885, Goldman took his son Henry and his son-in-law Ludwig Dreyfuss into the business and the firm adopted its present name, Goldman Sachs & Co.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-14) The company pioneered the use of [commercial paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_paper) for entrepreneurs and joined the [New York Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange) (NYSE) in 1896.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-Cohan2012-15) By 1898, the firm's capital stood at $1.6 million.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-Cohan2012-15)

Goldman entered the [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) market in 1906 when it took [Sears, Roebuck and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears,_Roebuck_and_Company) public.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-Cohan2012-15) The deal was facilitated by Henry Goldman's personal friendship with [Julius Rosenwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Rosenwald), an owner of Sears.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-Cohan2012-15) Other IPOs followed, including [F. W. Woolworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Woolworth_Company) and [Continental Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Can).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-Cohan2012-15) In 1912, Henry S. Bowers became the first non-member of the founding family to become a partner of the company and share in its profits.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-Cohan2012-15)

The bank is one of the [largest investment banking enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_investment_banks) in the world by revenue,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-3) and is a [primary dealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealer) in the [United States Treasury security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security) market and more generally, a prominent [market maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker). It is considered a [systematically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution) by the [Financial Stability Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Stability_Board). The group also owns Goldman Sachs Bank USA, a [direct bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_bank). Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 and is headquartered at [200 West Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_West_Street) in [Lower Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan) with additional offices in other international financial centers.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-4)

As a result of its involvement in securitization during the [subprime mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis), Goldman Sachs suffered during the [financial crisis of 2007--2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-6) and received a $10 billion investment from the [United States Department of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury) as part of the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program), a financial [bailout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout) created by the [Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008). The investment was made in November 2008 and was repaid in June 2009.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#cite_note-NewYorkTimes2009June17-8)

Several [former employees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_employees_of_Goldman_Sachs) of Goldman Sachs [have moved on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)) to work in government positions.

WE all have heard of Goldman Sachs, we already know a lot about them and their inclusion in the set of class actions filed almost immediately (like with in days of the "trading restrictions" in January). BUT who knew the CEO was an EDM DJ??? I mean talk about a split personality! I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. It's like oxymoron and ironic had baby! Additionally, he doesn't care if you like him. Look I'm not trying to paint a picture of a badass CEO who's actually a badass person. BUT So far that's what he looks like. Let us see if he still comes off as a cool badass after we take a look at how he runs Goldman.

So we have a little background, the basics. Now it's time for the bad press.

David Solomon:

He looks like a cool badass, in reality, he's an asshole. "David Solomon is the worst," one employee said referring to Solomon's management style. "No one likes him." Internal surveys showed that first-year analysts complain they are suffering mental health issues, sleep deprivation and other physical ailments because they are [forced to endure 100-hour-plus work weeks](https://nypost.com/2021/03/18/goldman-analysts-make-deck-begging-to-work-only-80-hours-a-week/) to keep up with a boom in trading and investment banking deals.

Gets pay cut in January 2021 for his part in 1Malaysia Development Brand. 36%

Prosecutors accused the bank's senior executives at the time of overlooking fraud and bribery in pursuit of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for bond sales to raise money for the fund while working for Malaysia's then-Prime Minister Najib Razak and 1MDB advisor Jho Low, who is accused of masterminding the fraud.

The fund was pilfered by Najib to the tune of $700 million, cash that went into the prime minister's own private bank account, and proceeds from the bond sales were reportedly used to pay bribes to Malaysian and Middle Eastern officials.

Gets a 20% raise in March 2020 - Wow that didn't last long... All while the market is starting dive as corona virus starts to really show it's ugly head.

Just because you're home doesn't mean you can work from somewhere really nice - like I do.

Few things annoyed Solomon more last year than an encounter with a junior employee in the Hamptons. The Goldman Sachs boss has told lieutenants how the underling walked up at a restaurant, introduced himself and pointed to associates with him -- in the middle of a workday.

The tale has become the CEO's go-to anecdote when he vents about his mostly-empty offices: proof that remote work has run amok.

Some who've heard the story note the apparent disconnect. The boss is perturbed by bumping into staff while he himself was spending extended summer weekends in the Hamptons at a luxe seaside rental. Solomon's time there even made national news after he deejayed a concert where attendees flouted social-distancing guidelines, leaving New York state officials fuming.

<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-15/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-wants-his-bankers-back-at-the-office>

The CEO of Goldman Sachs moonlights as a DJ and is even making (awful) dance tracks. We've had about enough of it. How electronic music is playing a vital -- and viral -- role in the whitewashing of Wall Street's most notorious bank. I don't even know how to summarize this one....

Goldman Sachs boss responds to leaked report into 'inhumane' working hours

The complaints suggested bankers at Goldman are still struggling with the long hours and high-pressure culture that was exposed when 22-year-old Goldman analyst Sarvshreshth Gupta took his own life in 2015. Gupta was found dead after complaining of working 100 hours a week and working all night.

<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/22/goldman-sachs-boss-responds-to-leaked-report-into-inhumane-working-hours>

At face Value, He looks like a badass executive with an awesome hobby. Just like the rest of the power crazy jerks who run wall street, he's just another asshole who works his employees to literal death and accepts no responsibility.

What about Goldman Sachs as whole?

Goldman Sachs either doesn't care about bad press, or just doesn't care if they get caught in General.

TL;DR

Goldman is shady as fuck and doesn't care about getting caught. CEO is an asshole.
