Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators ofÂ [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/).

Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose. (I have absolutely no idea what's wrong with it)

So in my post about Goldman Sachs I posted links for bad news on our friend Ken Griffin & Citadel. I was asked to make a post on each of dear friends involved with this whole international incident. I call it that because of the stockholders world wide and the many international investigations that are occurring. The ask was to remind us of who the apes are up against. So tonight I bring you Point 72 & Steve Cohen. It was a lot easier to find the bad news than it was with Griffin and Citadel, must not have a very good PR department.

As a reminder:

Don't post positions

Remove stop losses

don't forget to remove sell limits

No MOASS date predictions

The less they can see and mine the better off we are.

And as always not financial or investment advice.
