Good Morning GME! As the Art of war says: know thy enemy. So, Lets continue get to know our dear hedge fund friends.

So Lets Recap what we've learned so far about Citadel and Point 72, before we get to the main course of Two Sigma.

As always Remember:

1.  Don't post positions (BreaksÂ [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/)Â Rules)

-   No sharing positions i.e. 50 shares @ $90 avg

-   No Gain/Loss posts or comments (for now); a.k.a. Gain Porn or Loss Porn

-   Due to this rule assume that all Gain/Loss posts are fake

-   This is a temporary rule which will eventually be dissolved

1.  make no predictions

2.  remove stop losses

3.  remove your limit sells, instead set alerts.

5.Don't day trade GMEEÂ [Article: Trading hot stocks like GameStop seems fun until you look beneath the surface -- Financial Treason & Crime (stopnakedshortselling.org)](https://stopnakedshortselling.org/2021/02/article-trading-hot-stocks-like-gamestop-seems-fun-until-you-look-beneath-the-surface/)

6\. this is not not financial or investment advice

Recap: Citadel

Has gotten in trouble for using dark pools to manipulate the prices the stocks, has alleged ties to a coup taking over the Illinois state government, has previously been fined for market manipulations. Additionally, poaches staff from other hedge funds. Citadel has sued the SEC and the IEX president over a new method of order flow D-Limit. Ken Griffin also fires 10% of his employees every month for underperforming. Has a single piece of art that can cover the amount on money needed to pay shareholders in a squeeze. (Links to be provide at end - posted in another post, before starting the sort of daily hedge fund bad news began). Has a really good PR team. - Buys the rights to all the images of him, and tries their best to keep his personal life out of the press. Moreover, is skimming off the top of all trades that go through on PFOF. Bad Blood Between Citadel, SEC and other Hedge Funds.

Recap: Point 72's Steve Cohen

Been Fined and convicted of insider trading and failing to supervise staff engaged in insider trading. Has just recently come off a 4 year trading Freeze in china, has been sued for gender discrimination. got his ex-wife's fraud case against him dismissed, point72/Cohen has a long list of felonies. Cohen has even had a 2 year ban for trading for "failure to Supervise" assessed by the SEC and also paid them 135,000,000 fine. Has an Art Collection that can more than pay for squeeze.

Two Sigma, John Overdeck, and David Siegel (actually pretty clean, decent firm and people - or has a really good PR team - former employee steals from them). It appears that philanthropy is genuine - not a distraction from bad press.

My Honest Opinion on Two Sigma? They made the wrong decision at the wrong time. I'm guessing their involvement may have been band wagon - "Everyone else is doing it, so we will too." BUT continue to do puts because they are caught up in a cycle and just cannot bring themselves to pullout, because GREED.

Totally not What I was Expecting! If you can find something bad post it in the comments and I'll put it up here.

TL:DR

Citadel has a bad reputation and bad blood with pretty much everyone

Point 72 and Cohen, felonies galore, previous suspended trading privilege's U.S. and abroad

Two Sigma, John Overdeck & David Seigel: Basically decent human beings who got caught up in a bad trade. Still has a lot of put options on GME.
