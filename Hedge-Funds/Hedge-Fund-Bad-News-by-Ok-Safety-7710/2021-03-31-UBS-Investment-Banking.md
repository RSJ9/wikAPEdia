This morning I was going to write about Credit Suisse. However, last night as I trolling reddit before I went to sleep I came across another ape's post (Link Below). It was essentially a Research paper on UBS. As I was reading it I was clutching my pearls! This Hedge Fund is like the King Koopa of Hedge funds and males Citadel and Point72 look like the Hammer Brothers. For those that are thirsty for some for dirt, this is your morning!

UBS Group AG has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (GME) in the form of stock options. The firm currently holds 92,200 call options valued at $1,737,000 USD and 3,815,800 put options valued at $71,890,000 USD.Â <https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/ubs>

A quick summary of that post: UBS has a lot of problems with the legality of the law. A LOT. If your looking for something more in depth than this little post,Â [u/throwawaylurker012](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwawaylurker012/)Â has what your looking. It's a truly deep dive into the business and the people who run UBS. While I give a quick look at each hedge fund involved in the morning. That post is really great if you really want to know the most you can. I do encourage you to read it.

As always Remember:

1.  Don't post positions (BreaksÂ [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/)Â Rules)

-   No sharing positions i.e. 50 shares @ $90 avg

-   No Gain/Loss posts or comments (for now); a.k.a. Gain Porn or Loss Porn

-   Due to this rule assume that all Gain/Loss posts are fake

-   This is a temporary rule which will eventually be dissolved

1.  make no predictions

2.  remove stop losses

3.  remove your limit sells, instead set alerts.

5.Don't day trade GMEEÂ [Article: Trading hot stocks like GameStop seems fun until you look beneath the surface -- Financial Treason & Crime (stopnakedshortselling.org)](https://stopnakedshortselling.org/2021/02/article-trading-hot-stocks-like-gamestop-seems-fun-until-you-look-beneath-the-surface/)

So here we go!! so who is UBS?

UBS AG, abbreviation ofÂ United Bank of SwitzerlandÂ AG, major bank formed in 1998 by the merger of two of Switzerland's largest banks, the Swiss Bank Corporation and theÂ Union Bank of Switzerland.Â <https://www.britannica.com/topic/UBS-AG>

UBS Group AG has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (GME) in the form of stock options. The firm currently holds 92,200 call options valued at $1,737,000 USD and 3,815,800 put options valued at $71,890,000 USD .Â <https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/ubs>

UBS has done it all! Manipulations, short selling etc. If it's illegal in the finance, banking, and investment industry, you can bet your bottom dollar they have done it.

That is Just 2011 to present.

This reads like a criminal rap sheet. You got money laundering, currency manipulation, market manipulation, libor manipulation, spoofing, collusion, insider trading. I didn't even have to go outsideÂ [stopnakedshortselling.org](https://stopnakedshortselling.org/). UBS has 15, that's right FIFTEEN PAGES!

starting on page 3 here:Â <https://stopnakedshortselling.org/page/3/?s=UBS>

TL;DR

UBS IS THE Megalodon shark among the White Tip and Nurse Sharks.
