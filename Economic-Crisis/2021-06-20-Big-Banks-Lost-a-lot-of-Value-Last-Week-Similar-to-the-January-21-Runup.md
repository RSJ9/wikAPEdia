Big banks lost a lot of value on JANUARY 14th, but GME has started rising A WEEK LATER ON JANUARY 21! The big banks lost again at least 7.5% of value last week. Coincidence? I Think not.

I noticed that all the big bank stocks lost a lot of value on January 14th, but GME hasn't risen until around January 20/21 a week later.

Over the last week (5 days) the big banks lost a lot of value:

Goldman sacks: -7.58%, JP Morgan: -7.53%, Citigroup: -11.75%, Wells Fargo: -8.46%

All are also negative in Fridays after hours

TICK TOCK and buckle the fuck up!!! (how do i enter emojis on pc?)
