In 2011 CBO projected the 3 month Treasury bill to be worth 4.4% in 2021.

The actual 3 month Treasury bill rate for July 2021 is worth between 0.01 and 0.06%.

In 2011 the projected 10 year Treasury note bill rate was projected to be 5.4% for 2021

The actual 10 year Treasury note bill rate is 1.24% In July 2021

Personal Income: "Current-dollar personal income decreased $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, or 22.0 percent, in contrast to an increase of $2.33 trillion (revised), or 56.8 percent, in the first quarter of 2021."

Disposable personal income decreased $1.42 trillion, or 26.1 percent, in the second quarter, in contrast to an increase of $2.27 trillion, or 63.7 percent (revised), in the first quarter. - Again all fake gains thru the stimmy.

AT THE SAME TIME, Personal outlays (expenses) increased $680.8 billion in Q2, after already having increased $538.8 billion in Q1.

Personal savings was $1.97 trillion in the second quarter, compared with $4.07 trillion in the first quarter of 2021

The personal saving rate---personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income---was DOWN 10.9 % in the second quarter, which was already DOWN 20.8 % in the first quarter.

This means Americans have lost $2+ TRILLION in savings, Q2 2021 ALONE.
