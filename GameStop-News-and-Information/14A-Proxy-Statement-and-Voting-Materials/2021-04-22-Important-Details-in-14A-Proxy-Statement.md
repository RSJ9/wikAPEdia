MPORTANT!!! I'm sure everyone has seen that the Proxy materials were filed today. I wanted to call attention to a small but very important detail in the filing.

TL;DR: RC and BOD say to vote ASAP. This is not meant to create a frenzy. Just awareness. Don't be lazy and don't be passive. When you get your voting materials, read through them and vote. If you don't get notice from your broker within a couple days, then reach out to them and try to get an eta. Voting is an important part of being a shareholder.

Thank you to¬†[/u/thr0wthis4ccount4way](https://www.reddit.com/u/thr0wthis4ccount4way/)¬†for posting this very helpful guide for the proxy vote. It's still a work in progress but I've noticed several answers in it to many of the questions in the comments below!

You can also¬†[Read up on the information to be voted on](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/)¬†yourself. The BOD recommendations are on page 65.

In reading through the Proxy filing, I noticed something in the letter from Dan Reed on behalf of the Board of Directors.

RC and the rest of the board are requesting that shares be voted ASAP. This is different language than they used last year and the year before and¬†I THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL¬†*(may not be)*¬†AND IMPORTANT!!!

*It has since been pointed out by a commenter that there are other companies filings that include similar language and that GameStop actually has similar language in the previous filing in other places, just not in the notice letter. The change in language from previous GME filings is what caught my attention. Even if this isn't a subtle message, the point is still very valid that shareholders voting their shares is important and all who can participate, should try and do so and do so as soon as they can.*

I believe this could be a way for them to "confirm" the reasonable suspicion and provide evidence of the naked short-selling we all know is happening.

I have shares held though 5 different brokers and have only received the notification from 1 of them so far. I anticipate the others will be making contact, providing the resources tomorrow (otherwise, they'll be hearing from me). I have now officially voted the shares my TDA account.

I will be staying on top of this with my other brokers and make sure I get all of my votes in ASAP as requested by RC!

This is not financial advice. I just happened to notice something I think other shareholders might find important! Do with this what you will.

Edit: adding direct links to the filings referenced:¬†[2021](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/);¬†[2020](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-120938/);¬†[2019](https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-19-000087/)

Edit 2: Please don't harass your brokers!!!¬†(Unless it's RH--you need to make sure they don't send your materials to some boy in Bulgaria).¬†This is not meant to create a frenzy. Just awareness. Don't be lazy and don't be passive. When you get your voting materials, read through them and vote. If you don't get notice from your broker within a couple days, then reach out to them.

Edit 3: Still getting a lot of concerns about not getting voting info yet. It could be a couple of days. Voting period isn't even open yet. Don't worry voting won't close for another month. Point of the post and the ASAP in the filing is to do just that. Stay on top of it and do it ASAP. If you don't have voting materials within a couple days, reach out to your broker and try to get an eta. When you do get them, read them and vote. Simple. No panic necessary.

Edit 4: Added a few links, additional details from comments, and fixed TL;DR

Edit 5: clarified a statement that was being misunderstood and misrepresented

Edit 6: Added¬†[link to great voting resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mxa8gy/everything_you_need_to_know_about_14a_proxy/)¬†provided by¬†[/u/thr0wthis4ccount4way](https://www.reddit.com/u/thr0wthis4ccount4way/)

Edit 7: Updated with voting proof.
