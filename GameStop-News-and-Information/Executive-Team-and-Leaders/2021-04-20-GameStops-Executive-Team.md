I like the stock.

Total executives hired by Ryan Cohen, that were previously employed with:

Chewy - 5/10

Amazon - 5/10

Zulily - 4/10

QVC - 2/10

Arteza - 2/10

*I live under a rock like Patrick... who are these companies and what do they do?? Don't trip my ape, I gotchu!*

Chewy - Online retailer of pet food and pet related-products. Rumor has it that their [Customer Service game is so good, it'll make you wanna slap yo mama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skKTrYFDYg0)!

Amazon - Multinational technology company and the world's largest online retailer. It's no secret that Jeff Bezos, the world's second richest man started his enterprise by selling books via the internet. Once the digital transformation for GameStop is complete, Ryan Cohen and Friends can reach a similar level of success like Amazon in the very near future.

Zulily - E-commerce company that sells a variety of clothing, footwear, toys, and home products. Their main feature provides their customers with daily flash sales and that concept works pretty well with video games (just look at Steam).

QVC - Free-to-air television network and flagship shopping channel that specializes in televised home shopping. Quality Value Convenience, you may have scrolled past their informercials while surfing through your local TV channels. Also, I just want to throw out the parent company of QVC and Zulily is Qurate Retail Group.

Arteza - International E-commerce art supplier, this small start-up company got it's big break after securing a $24M funding from Volition Capital. Yes, the same equity firm that invested into Ryan Cohen and Chewy Inc. Props to Larry Cheng, co-founder of Volition Capital (also GameStop's newest director candidate) for believing in companies that provide the highest level of customer care and satisfaction.

We'll have to fight our way out. Are you ready?

FYI - If any new hires or promotions were to occur, I'll be editing this post with the updates.

This is not financial advice, I be not a financial advisor. Like Ralph Wiggum, I like to eat red crayons too.
