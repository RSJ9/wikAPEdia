VERY IMPORTANT WARNINGS

1) BE CAREFUL WHICH LINK YOU USE TO VOTE.

-   THERE ARE PHISHING WEBSITES MEANT TO TAKE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER.

2) DO NOT USE THE LINKS WITHIN YOUR EMAILS! SOME BROKERS DO NOT SEND THE FULL VOTES OUT.

-   INSTEAD, COPY THE CONTROL NUMBER FROM THE EMAIL AND FOLLOW THE OFFICIAL LINK FROM THE 14A PROXY STATEMENT FOUND ON THE SEC/GAMESTOP WEBSITE

-   *more details and references below*

Voting

-   Shareholders can vote for 3 proposals found in the proxy statement, as well as more during the Annual General Meeting to be held 6/9/2021

    -   *Election of Directors*

    -   *Advisory vote on Executive compensation*

    -   *Ratification of appointment of independent registered public accounting furm (Deloitte)*

-   You should receive an email from your broker with a Control Number used to vote.

    -   If your broker has not given you notice - call them and chase them for it.

-   [Vote using the Official Portal](https://www.proxypush.com/gme).

-   There are scams going around (obviously) meant to take your control number.

-   [Broker-By-Broker How to vote for Europeans](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwpqdf/europoors_what_needs_to_be_done_to_be_able_to/)

-   Remember that many brokers are not on your side ([restricted buying in Jan](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/), and [are paid by Citadel for order flow](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mbvplb/huge_citadel_is_paying_for_order_flow_from_nine/)) and [may not report all your AGM Votes](https://csbweb01.uncw.edu/people/moffettc/about/Research%20Papers/IIJ-JOT-BROOKS.pdf) ([highlighted section from the documen](https://preview.redd.it/fyk4rjhelxu61.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d54aff4d121c4d45ef8c47cdbcee4e6389185dc)t).

    -   I recommend that you follow GameStop or SEC's official 14A Proxy Statement, finding the official link in the bottom of page 1, following it and entering the Control Number.

-   The Board of Directors recommends that you vote 'FOR' (not 'against) every option, also found in page 1 of 14A.

Overvoting

-   RC & BOD [requesting to vote ASAP](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mwmjbf/important_request_by_rc_and_bod_for_votes_asap/).

-   It is [possible to overvote with synthethic shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mws33j/voting_rights_date_of_record_failure_to_deliver/gvk1u09) and has happened in the past.

-   [Overvoting would prove to be hard evidence showing the corruption surrounding naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwybt4/voting_is_the_catalyst_rc_cannot_prove_there_is/).

Observations from 14A

-   Reveals a [modest increase in actual outstanding shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mwjn3l/analysis_of_the_proxy_gme_has_not_sold_the_35/) between the filing of the 10K on 3/17 and the data collection for the proxy on 4/15, and has not sold much (if any) shares.

-   New Directors will get 200k of shares @ 30-day average price before starting employment.

-   Substantial increase to their liquidity was sales of existing corporate assets.

-   From the footnotes: [BlackRock may be able to vote, while Vanguard may not](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mww179/14a_tells_us_blackrock_can_vote_but_youd_have_to/).

-   [Gamestop now owes $47.1M in short-term debt and none in long-term debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mwq2lp/additional_updates_from_the_gme_proxy_statement/).

Calculating float from figures in the statement

-   Using figures from 14A: Outstanding shares - Institutional - Insiders = 26,644,355 floating shares. Kindly note that this calc. uses [SEC Filing data from EOY 2020, which are not representative of current institutional holdings](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1326380/000090266421001289/p21-0581sc13ga.htm).

    -   Speculation / Lack of Accurate Data: [Rough estimation of retail ownership ranges between 100-300% of float](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwskkv/retail_easily_owns_100300_of_the_remaining_float/).

    -   Another [rough estimation of float which incudes ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwi1zl/gme_float_dd_what_is_the_free_float/) = 16,923,496 floating shares.

    -   [Small-institutional ownership](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuutw/estimating_small_institution_gme_ownership/) (excluded above) own an additional 20M shares.

    -   Another [rough estimation excluding retail and some intitutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mwmkgj/shares_outstanding_simple_math_14a_etfs_terminal/) sums up around 68M share ownership.

    -   Considering all of the above estimations, it is quite safe to assume that there is a huge number of synthetic shares floating around.

Will be updating with more information tomorrow - it's late and I rushed the post out due to the phishing bullshit going around.

Let me know in the comments if I missed anything, or if something new pops up.
