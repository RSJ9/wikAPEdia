Letter from our Chief Executive Officer

April 22, 2021

Fellow Stockholders,

Thank you for your investment in GameStop. It is my privilege to serve as GameStop's chief executive officer, working with a group of highly-committed and knowledgeable Board members in stewardship of the long-term interests of all our stockholders.

As we move forward in 2021, we are focused on transforming GameStop into a customer-obsessed technology company that delights gamers. We are working to create a differentiated customer experience that positions us to access new customers, further engage with existing ones and reactivate former ones, while also focusing on initiatives that drive customer lifetime value. The strategic initiatives that support our goals include:

1.  Investing in technology capabilities, including our E-Commerce presence, systems and customer insights gathering.

2.  Building a superior customer experience, including by establishing a U.S.-based customer care operation.

3.  Expanding our product catalogue and addressable market. Certain emerging categories represent natural extensions that we believe our customers expect from us.

4.  Growing our distribution footprint fulfillment operations to improve speed of delivery and service. This will enable us to provide customers convenient, flexible, and competitive delivery options across the entire product spectrum.

We expect to accelerate these and other elements of our transformation while continuing to capitalize on the new console cycle. We believe the progress we have made over the past two years positions GameStop for long-term growth and to deliver value for stockholders.

As your fiduciaries, GameStop's Board remains committed to enhancing value for our stockholders. We appreciate your support of management and the newly refreshed Board as they work to continue to create value for all stockholders.

Sincerely,

ðŸ“·

George E. Sherman

Chief Executive Officer

Flip to page 26/27.

Napkin Math: 70,771,778 total shares

Top 6 institutions (removed RC)- 45.8%

Insiders- 16.5%

= 62.3% of shares or ~44.1M

70.8M total - 44.1M= 26.7M Shares Available (float estimate)

This is wayyy lower than the 40M-50M float assumption commonly used. Yes, top institutions can always sell some but...

Apes Own the Float (and prob a lot more)

Add in all the other institutions and the claim they own >120% of the shares.. LOL

HODL
