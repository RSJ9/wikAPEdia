TL;DR: Too much is going on right now in the financial world for it all NOT to be connected. And if Michael Bury and other financial experts are right, then the United States and other countries across the globe will soon be in a dire economic situation akin to the Great Depression. Where there is smoke, there is fire.

This truly isn't "original DD" as it is an easy source to find all the information relevant to a pretty common conclusion many of this sub are making;

The United States Economy is about to fail.

I will do my best on this post to list all the information in chronological order.

1.) The United States Government is responsible for reporting total liquidity in the markets, saving deposits, and large deposits in banks. These are known as M1, M2, and M3. However, they are no longer reporting 2 of the 3 sectors of liquidity in the markets.

[Just before the 2008 Financial Crisis, they have since stopped reporting M3 (large bank positions)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M3).

M3 (Discontinued as of March 13, 2006)

[And as of February 2021, they have stopped reporting M1 (total liquidity in the economy).](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1)

[![r/Superstonk - Where there is smoke, there is fire](https://preview.redd.it/skmpn49voju61.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e4b81b3b732ac0192f8ea8d17003c394befa14)](https://preview.redd.it/skmpn49voju61.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e4b81b3b732ac0192f8ea8d17003c394befa14)

M1 (Discontinued as of February 1, 2021)

In other words, trillions of dollars in the market are currently unaccounted for; especially the 40% of total US Liquidity that has been pumped into the economy as of May 2020.

2.) Michael Burry, the man who saw the Housing Market Collapse happening three years before it did, warned on Twitter again of how the current US Economy is "balancing on a knife's edge".

Final Tweet before account was deleted

Now, Michael Burry's Twitter account has been deleted and has continued to remain silent after the SEC visited his home.

From March 18, 2021

3.) In December of 2020, Warren Buffett has his company, Berkshire Hathaway, sell all their positions in large banks.

[![r/Superstonk - Where there is smoke, there is fire](https://preview.redd.it/on9y9klyqju61.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dacdd84fa383d4f7c6bf2cd377877af5bbf91b7)](https://preview.redd.it/on9y9klyqju61.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dacdd84fa383d4f7c6bf2cd377877af5bbf91b7)

Enough said.

[SEC Link of such transactions can be found here.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000095012321002786/xslForm13F_X01/0000950123-21-002786-3286.xml)

Here's a quick snippet of Berkshire Hathaway selling their bank positions (link above)

Warren Buffett also stated in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that the future of American Bonds is grim.

4.) The DTCC, SEC, Federal Reserve, and Congress are changing the structure(s) of the financial world like there's no tomorrow.

For one, there is now no longer a taxpayer bailout for big banks.

Effective March 19, 2021

The SEC is currently holding closed-door meetings every month instead of one every other year.

[![r/Superstonk - Where there is smoke, there is fire](https://preview.redd.it/vdxrvwp0tju61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f1ca0baf42b27914a59b2ba95b702625ce4a22)](https://preview.redd.it/vdxrvwp0tju61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f1ca0baf42b27914a59b2ba95b702625ce4a22)

At the same time, they have rushed to get a new SEC Head in during all of this occurring.

This happened of a Saturday.... but why?

And currently, the DTCC is creating dozens of new rules and regulations (in regards to short interest, options abuse, collateral, etc.)

[Link to DTCC site here.](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings)

Another thing that is super sketchy is how Congress has now called ALL big bank CEOs to testify in May in regards to unspecified reasons.

Just what in the world is going on?

5.) While big banks are reporting record profits in 2021, they're also asking for billions in liquidity from investors and are working non-stop overtime even on weekends.

Why would a bank who reports this;

[![r/Superstonk - Where there is smoke, there is fire](https://preview.redd.it/9myrjqqluju61.png?width=2718&format=png&auto=webp&s=351280cd96c5ca9141f41a678c6f7f69079e76d2)](https://preview.redd.it/9myrjqqluju61.png?width=2718&format=png&auto=webp&s=351280cd96c5ca9141f41a678c6f7f69079e76d2)

Seems good.... right?

Suddenly report this the very next day?

[![r/Superstonk - Where there is smoke, there is fire](https://preview.redd.it/115ci57ouju61.png?width=2704&format=png&auto=webp&s=011994c5abe408702ab8e5b378e04c0e210b26fd)](https://preview.redd.it/115ci57ouju61.png?width=2704&format=png&auto=webp&s=011994c5abe408702ab8e5b378e04c0e210b26fd)

Why do they need the liquidity?

Meanwhile, financial institutions across the globe are working hardcore overtime recently; 24/7 into the night even on weekends.

These banks from across the globe, during a pandemic where most of their employees are required to work from home, are suddenly ALL working at their main buildings at bizarre times...

At the same time, banks seem to be preparing for riots in local areas for no apparent reason.

[![r/Superstonk - Where there is smoke, there is fire](https://preview.redd.it/k92jwqcqxju61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdd014599311e2ae2e3dc1f9c7224634247575c)](https://preview.redd.it/k92jwqcqxju61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdd014599311e2ae2e3dc1f9c7224634247575c)

There's nothing happening in these areas, though...

[This Twitter user also captured a video on April 19th of dozens of police officers parking around the Department of Treasury for no apparent reason; doing nothing at the moment but stay at their positions.](https://twitter.com/maybe60794885/status/1384488283900719105)

Once again, I'm going to state this;

TL;DR: Too much is going on right now in the financial world for it all NOT to be connected. And if Michael Bury and other financial experts are right, then the United States and other countries across the globe will soon be in a dire economic situation akin to the Great Depression. Where there is smoke, there is fire.
