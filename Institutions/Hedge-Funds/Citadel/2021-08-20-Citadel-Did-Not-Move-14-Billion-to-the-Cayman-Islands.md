EDIT/CORRECTION: As some Apes have pointed out, FUD is probably the incorrect term for this post, it should be labeled as DEBUNKED. Sorry about that, too many crayons for breakfast.

EDIT2: I have chatted with the author of that tweet. To clarify my intent, I only wish to correct misinformation, not to launch personal attacks. I saw incorrect information and reacted strongly in this post with terms like FUD & DEBUNKED. This does not mean I will not continue to correct misinformation, just that I will do it with more tact.

EDIT3: The Author of the tweet still wanted this image below removed, I said no and will apparently be reported, I said go ahead, my patience has reached it's limits.

Yesterday I saw this post from¬†[u/einfachman](https://www.reddit.com/u/einfachman/):¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p7l5bl/kenny_sent_another_14_billion_to_cayman_islands/>

It was a screenshot from a Twitter account claiming that $14B was transferred to the Cayman Islands recently, they didn't and I can explain what's really happening.

I replaced the initial version of this with FUD overlaid, DEBUNKED is a better description and I wish I could alter the title of this post, I'll cut down on the morning crayons in the future.

I actually created a Twitter account for the purpose of replying to clear up the¬†~~FUD~~¬†misinformation, but apparently this account can't be replied to, any account that does not accept criticism sends up red flags, so I will clarify here.

This Form D¬†[was filed on May 5, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001199937/000180233221000005/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)¬†and¬†[I had already addressed why so many Form D's were being filed in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np6f78/citadel_has_been_filing_form_d_amendments_and_ill/). So this is actually old news.

This filing is an amended Form D. They must be filed annually OR if anything changes since the lat filing was made. As you can see, these filings have been going on for a while.

So, what is a Form D for? Here's the explanation from¬†[investor.gov](https://investor.gov/):

Registered securities are done of Form S-1, S-3, etc, UNREGISTERED securities are put on Form D. Here is the most recent filing, marked up to show what is happening:

Unlike that Twitter account, I will update this post with answers to any questions you may have.

MOASS is inevitable, buy & hold, not financial advice.
