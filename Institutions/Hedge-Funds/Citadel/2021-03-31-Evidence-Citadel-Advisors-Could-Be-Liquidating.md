Apes, I've been digging into some research around the crazy dumps around end-of-market today and am broadcasting my findings. Before diving into the details, my THEORY based on the findings is that the dumps could signal a liquidation by Citadel - reason being, a survey of the public companies representing the top 30 holdings of Citadel Advisors showed that each experienced a large sell-off (and in most cases a bonafide DUMP) during the last 10 minutes of regular trading today. Moving on.

First, need to set the parameters of what you're about to see. What I did was pulled data on the largest public company holdings of Citadel Advisors - specifically, the companies making up the Top 30 holdings in Citadel's portfolio (based on year-end 2020 13F and 13D filings). I then sorted them based on aggregate market value from highest to lowest. Then, I ticked through each of those company's trading history today (using a combination of Yahoo Finance and ToS) and added together the volume of the red candles between 2:50 p.m. ET and 3:06 p.m. ET - in the chart I've linked below, this is what is included in the "3/31 EOD Volume" entry for each company. Then, the column immediately to the right of that is where I multiplied the aggregate "red candle" volume by the price of the company in question that was a rough midpoint in the range between the first red candle and the last.

Interestingly, every single one of those 30 companies had a noticeable dump trend that started during the last 10 minutes of normal-hours trading (vast majority started at exactly 2:52). The aggregate red volume was significant in all cases, extreme in many. The numbers don't really help show the full picture there, so pull these up yourself on your portal of choice and take a look.

With that background out of the way, here is the mentioned table:

I don't want to start a frenzy by any means, so I would urge you to draw your own conclusions from this info. Personally, my gut tells me this is not coincidence, and there is a significant chance that it could be Citadel (and potentially other GME shorts) freeing up cash for something, whether on account of the SLR or you know what.

The sales I researched covered 30 companies and tallied roughly $9.7 billion in proceeds, which is obviously a rough approximation since not every dollar of the red volume was necessarily Citadel (or any other single entity) and all volume (whether red or green) involves a sale. Citadel's holdings span well beyond 30 companies, so this could in theory just be the tip of the iceberg.
