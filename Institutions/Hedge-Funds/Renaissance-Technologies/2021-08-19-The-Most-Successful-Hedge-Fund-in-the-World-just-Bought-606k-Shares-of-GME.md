A few comments there drew my attention to Renaissance Technologies, TBH I have never heard from them before, So I did what every smart ape does, I go to wikipedia:

Okay so let me get this straight: The most successful hedge fund in the world, which only acts based on mathematical models/statistics/hard facts and not on emotions/human behavior...etc just recently bought 606k GME shares... TITS OFFICIALLY JACKED!

Effective date is 06-30, so who knows if they are still in right now. Also something to mention: In their 2020-09-30 13F they had 800k shares but they were gone in their 2020-12-31 13F so they sold their first 800k‚Ç¨ shares before the first big run-up in January...Maybe they learned from their mistake :-D
