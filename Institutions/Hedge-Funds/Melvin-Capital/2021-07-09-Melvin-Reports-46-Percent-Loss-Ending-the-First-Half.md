Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital Management, targeted by the Reddit army of traders for its bearish [GameStop](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/gme-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) bets, ended the first half of the year with a 46% loss, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/melvin-can-t-shake-reddit-attack-with-46-loss-in-first-half?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=business&utm_medium=social&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businesstwitter-business).

The New York-based hedge fund, which suffered a stunning [53% loss in January](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/melvin-capital-gabe-plotkin-took-home-846-million-in-2020-2021-2?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) from the Reddit-trader short squeeze, gained 1% in June. But it is still struggling to recover, Bloomberg said in the Thursday report, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Melvin Capital, founded by star portfolio manager Plotkin, did manage to stage something of a comeback with a 22% gain in February. But its overall [first-quarter loss stood at 49%](https://www.businessinsider.com/gabe-plotkin-melvin-capital-performance-march-2021-4?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest), Insider understands.

The hedge fund [got torched by the Reddit army](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hedge-funds-torched-wall-street-bets-gamestop-short-squeeze-reddit-2021-1?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) alongside other high-profile firms that had big bets against GameStop when traders banded together to send shares of the gaming retailer skyrocketing. When the price of a stock rises, short sellers [must typically cover their positions](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-short-selling-works-why-it-didnt-work-on-gamestop-2021-1?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) by buying shares at that higher price.

Melvin Capital lost a chunk of its assets in the trading frenzy, ending January with $8 billion in assets, [down from $12.5 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-melvin-idUSKBN2A00KW) at the start of the year. Its assets [had risen to $11 billion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-squeeze-melvin-capital-light-street-losses-meme-stocks-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) as of June 1, the Financial Times and Bloomberg reported.

After the January hit, the fund has somewhat recovered. It is up 18% for the five months between February and June, Insider understands. It gained 5.4% in the second quarter.

The hedge fund is understood to be taking smaller-sized positions to limit its exposure to single companies. It [exited its public short positions](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/melvin-capital-closes-out-public-short-positions-after-gamestop-losses-2021-5?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) against GameStop, AMC and other stocks in the first quarter, but may have still held non-public, more traditional short positions.

Founder Gabe Plotkin has also asked a team of data scientists to comb through social media and day-trader forums for stock names of interest to retail traders, Bloomberg reported.

A spokesperson for Melvin Capital declined to comment.
