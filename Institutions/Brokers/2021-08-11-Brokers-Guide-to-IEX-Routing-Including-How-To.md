So [u/Zinko83](https://www.reddit.com/u/Zinko83/) and I thought it would be helpful to compile a list of brokers which offer IEX routing. Thanks to all apes who have helped with useful information, to help create this guide. All information have been gathered by either me contacting each broker, or numerous fellow apes who have helped investigate.

So as I said the goal is to compile a list of brokers whom do IEX routing, along with a link to some DD which shows how to route your trades through IEX with each listed broker.

**Saxo Bank:** They offer IEX routing, however it's not controllable, they route their buys through the exchange with the best execution. You cannot decide for yourself. This includes both Citadel and IEX. Would therefore not recommend. Verified by [u/HelloYouBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/u/HelloYouBeautiful/)

**Fidelity:** Does not support this at the moment. There is a huge push from customers to gain this ability, however they are not acting on this as of yet.

**TD Ameritrade:** Offers routing through IEX only for US customers.

**IBKR:** Offers routing through IEX to clients worldwide.

**E\*Trade:** Offers routing through IEX, unsure offered in Europe, but definately offered to US clients.

**Revolut:** Does not offer IEX routing.

**Degiro:** Does not offer IEX routing.

**Charles Schwab:** Does not offer IEX routing. They would strongly consider if enough retail made a push for it. However I, myself, would not wait for a broker to act. Instead I would voice my opinion to them, and in the meantime choose a different broker for IEX routing.

**Tiger Brokers:** Does not offer IEX routing.

As a supplement to this guide I recommend a great guide by [u/socrates6210](https://www.reddit.com/u/socrates6210/) which lays out nicely which brokers turned off buying in January, who they use for clearing and etc. It is an excellent write up. [The Broker Preparation Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mowzjk/the_broker_preparation_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Again, we are just trying to help. Any verifications and information that is missing is more than welcome to bring it to my attention and I will edit as necessary.

Edit: No canadian brokers support IEX. They use the best execution price, which on some days is up to 50% (according to data from other posts) in darkpools controlled by citadel. Same goes for most european brokers. In this list there is brokers that accept clients worldwide. Euro and canadian apes can open an account on one of the international brokers, to route their future buys through IEX. As for UK, you can use TradeStation.
