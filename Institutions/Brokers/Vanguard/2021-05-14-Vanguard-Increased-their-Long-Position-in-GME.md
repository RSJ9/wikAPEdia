It looks like Vanguard increased their long position in GME with about more 400k shares since last filing.

Vanguard fucks.

Edit:¬†~~They bought those shares between 1st January and March 31. Which means they are also bullish as fuck even with GME being at highest levels during that time frame.~~

Edit2: Some people have said that ETF weighing is responsible for the increased shares. I am not too knowledgeable about that matter so I cannot comment too much. However, the fact (unless they misreported) is that VANGUARD GROUP INC owns more GME shares than the previous filing. Would love some more wrinkled brain to shed some light into this.
