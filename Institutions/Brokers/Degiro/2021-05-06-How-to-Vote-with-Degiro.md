This is an educational post.

Keep in mind: It will cost €10 but I would really concider doing it. 10 Euros is really not that much.

I will give a little introduction on how Degiro works so if you want to skip to the voting tutorial just scroll down to the ape-rocket emojis.

So while Degiro a few days ago simply said that they could either give you a UBO (utimate benificial owner) certificate and try to contact Gamestop directly, they also said that they could try to contact their clearing bank with my instructions on how to vote so that they then would vote on my behalf.

It seems like they got flooded with requests to vote on Gamestop so they now set things in motion for the last point to be fully set in motion. So this is now the way to cast your vote and it is no longer an uncertainty but their official and guaranteed way to let you vote.

So here is how it works:

No matter if you hold a basic/trader account or a custody account, in both of the situations your shares are held in an omnibus account of Degiro. That is also the reason why they can't hand out control numbers. You don't own one specific share but rather a percentage of that omibus account. This could sound like problem but it really isn't. They don't allow the shares to be lent out (no matter the account type) and therefor all the shares are held in an 1:1 ratio in that omnibus account. So if 10 million apes hold a cummulative of 30 million shares on Degiro then the omnibus account will represent that in a 1:1 way. The reason they do it this way is that it makes it cheaper and easier for Degiro to handle all the trades through one big account than several million different ones. That's why they're able to keep the fees so low.

How to vote:

1\. Contact Degiro via E-Mail.

The E-Mail depends on the country you live in but it always starts with "ca@degiro".

So if you live in Germany/Switzerland then the adress would be: <ca@degiro.de>

If you live in the UK then the adress would be: <ca@degiro.co.uk>

France: <ca@degiro.fr>

Italy: <ca@degiro.it>

Portugal: <ca@degiro.pt>

Sweden: <ca@degiro.se>

Netherland/Belgium: <ca@degiro.nl>

Greece: <ca@degiro.gr>

Czech Republic: <ca@degiro.cz>

I think you get it. It's just the country code that changes.

You simply send an email to that adress with a title like "Voting in Gamestop shareholder meeting" where you say something like "I would like to take part in the voting in the annual shareholders meeting of Gamestop 2021"

2\. Their reply

They answer you (for me I got the answer after only 5min) with a prewritten text with instructions on how to cast your vote. It may be worded a little bit different in all the different languages but it comes down to them demanding of you to:

Send them an additional Email to the same adress "<ca@degiro.xx>" with:

-   With the Email your account is registered on

-   Stating that you agree with the costs of 10 Euros being withdrawn from your account

-   Your complete instructions on how to vote

3\. Example of voting instruction email

Here is an example of how such an Email could look like:

-------------------------------------------------------

Titel of Email:

Voting Instructions Gamestop Annual Shareholders Meeting 2021

1.  Election of directors

1.1 George E. Sherman -for

I agree that the fee of 10 euros will be paid from my account.
