If anyone is interested, I created a cheat sheet. Fidelity lets us put in Limit Orders for 50% of the current price. I laid out prices from 50k to almost the moon, so that if we reach these prices, I can tell just where to set the Limit Sell. Pretty elementary, I know, but I figure my brain will short circuit when it's happening.
