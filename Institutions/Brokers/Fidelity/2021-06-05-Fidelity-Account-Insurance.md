Hello - I've heard rumor that for example, gme goes beyond the moon. Once the stock is sold Fidelity will automatically separate the funds into accounts so that the full amount will be federally insured. Is this accurate? If not is there process that can be set up in advance to handle a large influx of cash?

Additionally the same question(s) when transferring cash from another broker into fidelity and having all funds federally insured

Hi [u/Wowu812](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wowu812/),

The FDIC deposit sweep program is available in the [Fidelity Cash Management Account](https://www.fidelity.com/cash-management/fidelity-cash-management-account/overview) and eligible retirement accounts. This program holds your uninvested cash balance in an FDIC-eligible deposit account with our participating program banks. If you have more than $245,000 in uninvested cash in your account, the program maximizes your eligibility for FDIC insurance by systematically allocating this uninvested cash across multiple program banks.
