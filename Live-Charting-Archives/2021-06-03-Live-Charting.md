Good Morning Superstonk,

I just got off the phone with my doctor and having dreams of humanoid pickles boofing chicken tendies is absolutely normal. He said it's an extremely common symptom of having your titttz jackked to the max. It's like walking around with my own GPS for the moon cause they only point up!

I wanted to share this as I really hope some of you are also experiencing these symptoms. The cure appears to be very simple and homeopathic; just fuk some hedgies...

And more to that point

After Market Wrap Up

Weird day volume dissipated shortly after that last big dip and GME to claw back some of the day's losses, We are still well with our range on the 4hr timescale. I'm definitely curious to see what happens tomorrow. There were massive sell-offs in the SPY and TSLA 2 of Citadel's largest long holdings and also several other SHF with GME interest. Thank you all again for tuning in and for the amazing support. See you bright and early tomorrow to wrap up the week.

Edit 8 3:04

Back down if the support line continues we could close at 265~ but unless some volume pops up looks like more chop.

Edit 7 2:00

We did it back above 270

Edit 6 1:08

Little post-lunch test of 270 failed but we are consolidating above VWAP

Edit 5 12:11

Coming back up to test VWAP volume is still probably too low for a move

Edit 4 11:00

Dipping below 250 could test 242 again

Edit 3 10:49

Volume down chopping sideways just under resistance. Let's see if we get another huge midday move

Edit 2 10:04

Nice bounce looking to cross 260 and VWAP

Edit 1 9:45

Market down, Bonds tanking, vix up, relax guys these are the things we wanted. Looks like GME is gonna test 242.5. Diamond hands in the making today. 300k shares already borrowed.

Pre-Market Analysis

I know, everybody's thinking "wh*t the fuck is going on" well let me tell you what I think, I think short hedges are short a bunch of different places AMC, NOK, BB, BBBY. These positions can also effect their overall margin requirements. So I think they are closing them in one last ditch effort to stave off the margin call. Imagine them as all as our launch sequence. Watching these lesser primates enjoying there trans-atlantic flights before we can go on our well deserved trip to the moon can be frustrating, as the OG apes we must continue to be patient as they enjoy their in-flight chicken nugget meal. I'm pretty sure that some of those nugget-eaters may be dumping those meals into our fuel tank soon.

This morning's action is simple looks like 1.3M shares available to borrow with 300k borrowed. They may try to hit us pretty hard but pre-market volume approach 300k looks like we might be in for a wild morning. I think we will gap fill after any opening dip back up to re-test 290. Especially if we clear 270 in pre-market.
