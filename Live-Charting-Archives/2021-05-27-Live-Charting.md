After Market Pickle Party

Closed solidly above that 252.5 resistance. I am actually jacked to the titzzzzz. Thank you all so much for tuning in today and for the unbelievable amount of support you guys are actually amazing. Let's see if we can hit 300 for the long weekend as 5k more options are now ITM with plenty more to go as we keep ramping up. Seems like the shorts were saving the best squeeze for last...

Edit 7 2:52

With interest in the market diverted elsewhere GME is running a bit low on gas but we crossed VWAP and I think we are looking solid going into power hour we've had no major dips and a test of 250 still seems likely.

Edit 6 1:34

Looking to hold that bottom support line if it fails we can see a dip I don't expect we would drop below 220. If we get a bounce and some volume I'm still looking for the upward test at 250.

Edit 5 12:16

Slow climb back into this lower channel if we can retest VWAP and cross I could see another test at 250 before EOD. I think the shorts have about used the borrow for today. So not looking at a lot of sell pressure right now.

Falling slightly below the daily trend line volume at 7 million FOMO seems distracted by AMC

Edit 3 10:43

Small short attack there reverting us back to VWAP several sell walls going up behind the drop 5k at 245. Hopefully we can hold VWAP if it fails the test looks for a small dip.

Edit 2 10:16

Failed a double test of 250 looks like we are gonna consolidate and test again our volume is actually much lower than expected

Edit 1 10:00

Just smashed through 240 let's see if this can take us up into the 250 range we are currently looking bullish with decent buy-side volume coming in

Pre-Market Analysis

Small Gap down in pre-market currently trading at $233.66 but I suspect we will fill that gap before market open or slightly after. 250K shares available to borrow on Iborrow and 616k on fidelity. With volume picking up currently at 183k. I think we are gonna be in for another interesting day as we continue the battle for $250.

As we know MACD and TTM are already firing and beginning their cycle of volume and volatility. Our last indicator has Triggered CV-VWAP the arbitrage indicator that triggered before the last 2 run-ups in January and February.

CV-VWAP on the 4h

This indicator also fired before the short squeeze on VW back in 2008. So I expect some crazy things in the next day or 2.
