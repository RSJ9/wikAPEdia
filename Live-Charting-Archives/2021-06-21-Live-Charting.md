Edit 7 3:17

We've switched to the one tick timescale in order to have more fun on no volume while we orbit 200 support/resistance.

Edit 5 12:36

Failed test at VWAP. It will probably turn around and re-test

Edit 4 11:58

Dipped a little below 200 still trending down on no volume maybe a continuation of the pattern last week down all day then up a bit in power hour

Edit 3 10:56

Some sell volume came in driving us down to $200 institutional shuffling or shorting hard to say. Matt Furlong now officially CEO.

Edit 2 10:38

Low volume. Dipped below the 212.50 trading sideways above 205 we could dip more possibly down to 200.

Edit 1 9:49

Dip down to the 212.50 resistance if we don't hold we could dip further I think 200 will be pretty strong but if the market comes down hoard we could get dragged a bit

Pre-Market Analysis

50k volume 35k shares available up to $217 but mostly flat probably not a big dip at open but also maybe a fill back to 222.50
