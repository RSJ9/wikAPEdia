Have a great weekend everyone!

We're on track for being the lowest volume day (less than 4.7 million) since before the Jan spike.

Edit 11 2:43PM:

2 hours of low volume lmao. ZZzzzzz. Hopefully we actually get some "power" during power hour.

Power hour:¬†<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XoLaWv-Js&ab_channel=WardenElite>

Moving up on low volume. Nothing significant happening yet.

Edit 5 10:26AM:

Nothing really happening so far. A couple 160 and 200 strike Calls sold. Probably sold to close or covered calls.

Edit 1 9:31AM:

First minute candle 192k volume. Pretty low. Perhaps a quiet market open followed by a bang later in the day.

Gooooooood morning my fellow apes!

Well the day has finally come. The great exercise day. By exercise, I mean stand up in your room and stretch your arms. Do some jumping jacks and prepare for whatever the heck GME has in store for us today.

We saw a bit of a pullback on Thursday, and I'm expecting Friday to be a continuation of Wednesday's mad rally. Seems DFV has been on a bit of a tweeting spree recently. Maybe he knows something is up? Getting a bit pumped for what will happen very soon? Who knows. All I know that he knows, is that he really likes the stock. So do I.

Premarket Analysis

Shorts really do love hammering it in the premarket. Broader market gapping up in the premarket but GME hammered down.
