Good Morning Apes!

Welcome to my 3rd DD in as many days...If I seem burnt out it's because I am.

I'm pretty excited today as we have already had a nice gap up in pre-market after EU markets closed yesterday at $230. We may not get that possible morning dip as it looks like we are going back up. It's looking like we are gonna be in for another crazy week.

After Market

Closed just shy of 250 as we didn't make that last little jump to put those 2k options ITM but overall a good looking day up 12% is definitely nothing to complain about. I think we are in a a good position to see a morning test of 260. Thank you all again for tuning in. I will see you guys bright and early tomorrow at 9am EDT.

Edit 7 3:34

Slipped down from that 250 resistance looks like we might be closing around 242.5-245

Broke it maybe a 260 EOD? Looks strong above that upper trendline.

Edit 5 2:02

Failed the test at 250 let's see if we can bounce back and test again

Edit 4 12:22

Officially over 242.50 resistance looks like we are gonna at least tickle 250

Edit 1 9:45

Just cleared one million volume heading back up hopefully we can push through resistance and test that $240

Pre-Market Analysis

Pre-Edit 2

Volume up at 264k already. As always remember to store your tray tables in the upright and locked position...

Pre-Edit 1

I thought we could see an early morning dip but it looks like we bounced off the upper support after yesterday's action over on the EU market so although it's possible to still test that lower support I think we are going to test $240 around market open.

If we are looking for a dip it will be on the back of a failure in this upper support line

It also looks like we are filling in that downward price action from Friday pretty sure this will continue till open if we open above $240 I expect an immediate test at $250 resistance.
