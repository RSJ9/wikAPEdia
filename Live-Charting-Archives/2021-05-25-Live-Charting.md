Good Morning Future Dillionaires!

It's me pickle guy here with another day of market fuckery. Yesterday the SHF dumped about 330,000 shares at around 2:45 in what has been the most concentrated effort to drop the price that I've seen since the 10th. It didn't do much however as we still closed ever so slightly above 180. We know were the mayo is and our sandwiches are dry af, I hope Kenny is keeping it nice and warm.

*As price action picks up today, I may walk away from the reddit post while managing positions, if this is the case you can find me on the stream and discord for a while longer at the links below.*

Pickle-Time After Party

Well now that we are fully slathered in ken's mayo I think we are getting ready to just absolutely launch into the stratosphere. Finally broke to the upside of $200 dollars today closing beautifully right at the 210 resistance. I think we may see some post-market action but nothing major as liquidity dries up.

Breaking to the upside of that ascending pattern as we get ready to enter stage 2 of the ascent, who's ready for some FOMO? Thank you all so much for hanging out today your support as always has been so meaningful to me. Remember your all worth millions and should never settle for a penny less! See you tomorrow morning at 9am.

Looking for a test of 200 after passing that 192.50 resistance

Chop on 190 volume is really low maybe a real power hour today?

Edit 6 12:17

Head shoulders broke to the downside looks like we might hit 190 and sit there volume is still really low.

Edit 5 11:21

Failed the 190 test dipping down below VWAP. Market is also down right now.

Looking for a break to the upside of this consolidation

Edit 3 10:30

The TA citadel doesn't want you to know about if we hold this 192.5 we could test 200 with a break to the upside of that last triangle.

Edit 2: 10:06

Pretty solid rejection at 190 about 200k shares dumped if we cross back over VWAP i expect another test

Edit 1: 9:46

The oracle of the pickle jar reporting in! Testing 190 at 800k volume looking real strong we could see 200 today if this trend continues

Pre-Market Analysis

I hoping for a test of 190 out of the gate much like yesterdays move up. We hit 182. 50 in the pre-market and then got rejected so at minimum a test of 182.5o again if that succeeds a test at 190.

BBKC/TTM is still throwing the buy signal

and I expect a completion of the bull flag pattern.
