Good Morning Superstonk!

Pickle dude here for another exciting day of live charting, streaming etc.

This morning I have a couple things to actually cover in the intro.

If our price action continues to improve throughout today and crosses the $200 resistance. I will begin considering that GME has entered Stage A of My predictions for MOASS.

3 Stages of MOASS

From my Exit DD

Secondly something I stumbled upon looking into Glacier Capitol. I was immediately suspect when an apartment in Luxembourg was considered verification that they didn't exist (there are lots of 1-2 man/woman hedge funds usually working under a larger fund, like in The Big Short) So I did a little digging and aside from several LLC's being registered under that name in London, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania. I found these 2 things that seemed interesting. As the seemed relevant to the discussion at hand. I'll leave further digging up to the people on this sub that do that best.

Interesting that they were Registered 14 days before the action on Jan.28 https://lu.lei.report/LEI/984500BB91F55397AC42

I also stumbled on this looking into the US LLC's. Seems like a similarly named LLC bought an Insurance Company with our good buddies over at Susquehanna...

If that's any help to those digging for stuff on this I hope it helps. Maybe look into the panama stuff? Lastly on this subject, never be so dismissive of these things in the world of finance Luxembourg has off-shore money and laundering written all over it. Follow the money.

I think this warning remains valid this week so I will reiterate it *

Looks like a close between 182.5 and 185

Still sitting between 185-189 I hope we get a last 15 min breakout to actually test 190

Edit 6 12:35

Chop on resistance bulls can use this opportunity to dump volume for a breakthrough as there is less time to respond on short side due to the price being so close.

Edit 5:11:29

Looks like a triple top if we fail we could have a small dip maybe back to 175. If volume picks up look for a break above 182.5 in order to move higher

Pre-Market Analysis

Looks like there were a few gap ups in the pre-market, all filled. Most likely bull side as they try to keep the price from dipping below 180 resistance. This looks like they hope to try to push through in the pre-market or at open . so 9:00-9:45

After/Pre-Market 1M timescale

MACD crossed over as predicted yesterday on the Daily I can see us getting at least a few more days of price improvement in our future at least 4 based on previous patterns as we pick up volume and volatility
