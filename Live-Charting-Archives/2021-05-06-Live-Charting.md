Good Morning Superstonk!

Well yesterday was an interesting day, we say the NYSE freeze, our intraday volume disappear, some people stopped by to do AMA's and some old friends stopped by to bolster our confirmation bias (missed ya¬†[u/WardenElite](https://www.reddit.com/u/WardenElite/)). But has anything really changed? No. Fuckery is still afoot and most people in this sub still own a stock that has more than 100% of it's float sold short.

I know I'll get a thousand questions on this today so I'll answer it now. I don't really use OBV very often it's another momentum indicator. In the past I've used it to track so-called "smart money" as volume will drastically increase when institutions enter positions vs. when retail buys in. As far as a long term indicator I'm not sure of it's value, It can be prone to false signals and drastic price moves ,of which GME has had many, these can throw it's values for a long time.

However, Warden and I, even though our methods differ have arrived at similar conclusions, short pressure is weakening and we are headed for a convergence point soon where this will all hit the fan. If you haven't gotten a chance feel free to check out my DD from this last weekend and the previous week for more on my theories.

Lastly, almost all major brokers now have their proxy material available. If you own a company you should be making your opinion heard. Vote.

After-Market Wrap up

Well holy value batman! Guess we found out direct from the head of the DTCC today who owns a stock that is more than 140% short *thumbs at myself* this guy !

Closing stats for the day up slightly seemed to be a small surge carrying us above VWAP right before close. Massive news. Overall an awesome day. I will try to get a video out tonight going over the specifics of this whole DTCC thing but this is massive¬†Confirmation¬†of several theses regarding this stock. I will be getting to questions as fast as I can they are flooding in.

Again thank you for all the support, I will see you bright and early tomorrow!

Edit 13 3:42

Still sideways under VWAP

Edit 12 3:11

This does not mean immediate MOASS the market has to absorb this.

BREAKING NEWS !!!!

I'm pretty sure the Head of the DTCC said that back in January the only company that hard a margin issue was Robinhood and their capital requirements were met. Meaning that nobody else was margin called in January.¬†The SHORTS HAVE NOT COVERED.

Edit 11 2:44

Ok we dropped a bit below VWAP still sideways and back in the wedge.

Edit 10 2:00

Dipping back down to VWAP but still just chop no volume, no signals, and no movement. HFC hearing is focusing a lot on topics more related to politics and the market, and less on the actual issues at hand.

Edit 9 1:28

GME still sitting on top of resistance no action to speak of as the House Financial Services Committee plays out, I don't expect anything to happen unless something actionable is said.

Edit 8 12:35

Gary Gensler looks like he was grown in a pod and dropped into his grandfather's suit. Still sideways at resistance.

Edit 7 12:08

Chopping sideways at 162 probably awaiting testimony from dtcc and finra before we see any action. You can bet there are eyes on this. Streaming the event now on my channel.

Edit 6 11:56

Broke through 162.5 looking very good nice stable uptrend with no relevant sell walls in place.

Edit 5 11:25

Moving up, albeit slowly, to test 162.5 there are some sell walls so I expect we will need some volume to break through.

Edit 4 10:52

Looking strong as we push up to 160 volume is still low but better than yesterday?

Edit 3 10:38

I was misinformed by lack of coffee this morning but TTM is actually @ 5 fire indicators not 4

Retesting and fail. The plot thickens.

Edit 2 10:22

Multiple failed tests of VWAP 157 resistance is holding for now although we could break to the downside like yesterday.

Edit 1 9:55

350k volume traded. Testing VWAP. If we breakdown from a test expect a dip as 500k shares borrowed this morning.

Pre-market Analysis

Tiny gap down, tiny gap up nothing concerning

This is where we are starting our day on that wedge formation

CV VWAP is stable, but TTM Squeeze is showing 4 fire signals on 1D timeframe (this triggers on 5 or more) Whoops ! No coffee that number is 5.
