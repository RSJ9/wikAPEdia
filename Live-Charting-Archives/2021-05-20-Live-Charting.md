Hello Superstonk!

I hope everyone is well. I am getting ready for what I can only assume is going to be another pretty turbulent day. The S&P 500 gapped down and filled early this morning and is still looking unstable. Crypto markets are rallying back after the dip yesterday. Also we have some new regulation coming that went into effect yesterday in the after-market. I haven't had a chance to look into this yet as I have had a really crazy 24 hours personally. But if any more well informed apes care to handle questions on that I would greatly appreciate it.

Which brings me to my next point, I had a quite sudden family emergency arise yesterday and have to fly-out today there will be no live-charting or stream on Friday. I am so sorry for the sudden warning but I did not have a chance to plan this myself.

I will be¬†hosting a live-chat on the discord channel¬†this Friday and as always you can DM with questions . I will be aware of the markets Friday just unable to conduct my usual business. I am so sorry for the inconvenience this causes you guys but I should be back bright and early Monday and will attempt to at least push out the Technical DD for next week.

think this warning remains valid this week so I will reiterate it *

*As price action picks up today, I may walk away from the reddit post while managing positions, if this is the case you can find me on the stream and discord for a while longer at the links below.*

Last update for the day. Thank you all for tuning in it looks like we are bouncing on VWAP. I'm looking for a crossover on the lower resistance of that bull flag for a possible test at 180 today. Otherwise same old max pain. Tomorrow could be interesting as there was no good time to roll options this week and that OI is still kind of nuts. See you all Monday.

Edit 5 1:20

Shot up above vwap but still not crossing that lower band of the bull flag. Watching for the end of this consolidation for a test

Edit 4 12:00

Could see new intraday low if the downtrend continues as we have now dropped below 170 support

Edit 3 11:17

Bull pennant forming on the 1-min 54% chance for an upside break although i think it is lower because of reduced volume.

Edit 2 10:21

Broke through the bottom resistance of that bull flag looking to break out of the top by eod. Exactly as predicted...

Edit 1 10:00

Looks like we are seeing that uptrend I predicted I am looking for a test of 180 at a minimum today ideally 190. Volume 500k shares borrowed 130k

Pre-Market Analysis

Pre-Edit 1

Had a bit of a volatile spike right at the open of the EU markets could be due to regulations coming into effect or just some retail see some positive news articles for a change.

It also looks like we broke to the downside of that second bull flag, but with the 400k shares borrowed yesterday and the overall market action, I expect that we can return to the upside similar to the fuckery that occurred at the end of the pennant last Wednesday.

MACD still looking bullish as it continues to diverge

BBKC and TTM still looking bullish not a lot of change here till we see more explosive action

Even with the pre-market spike it looks like very little arbitrage occurred on CV VWAP
