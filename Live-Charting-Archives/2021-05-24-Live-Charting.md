Good Morning Everyone!

It's good to be back! Thank you everyone for the well wishes, It really meant a lot to me. Your support and friendship has been tremendous these last few weeks. All is well, and I am ready to get back to stonk watching with you guys.

I am currently getting myself hyped up for another Monday. Based on the continuing crypto crash over the weekend I expect some of that liquidity to flow into GME today. I am looking forward to another strong Monday this week.

I think this warning remains valid this week so I will reiterate it *

Closed up for the day, overall a win. I think some of that downward action was some stop-losses probably not apes but there was also some S&P consolidation there as well. I think we look pretty good going into tomorrow. Let's see what happens in after hours but I would love to just test 190 right out of the gate. Thank you all for tuning in and all the support. I will be jumping on questions for about an hour then going to bed. See you all tomorrow.

Pushing 180 again a close above 182.5 would be a huge win

Edit 7 3:18

Did a little dippy-poo but looks like we are bouncing back to test 180 again. What a pathetic short attack.

Edit 6 2:48

Dip ! 100k shares sold and more coming looks like they are trying to push us under 180

Flat as the desert our volume was harvested in. But still holding that support.

Edit 4 12:56

Still trading sideways along the 185 resistance Plenty of consolidation I'd like to see another attempt at 190 before EOD

Edit 3 11:32

Consolidating on 185 right now 180 looking like confirmed support so at least 1 step closer to getting our hands on some of that nice warm mayo. Bull flag I predicted should be a little above 190 so I'm still looking for that test.

Edit 2 10:37

Breaking to the upside of this pennant on 1.12M volume. At least we are holding strong at 180 for now,

Pre-Market Analysis

We got a pretty hard spike on the open of the EU markets this morning jumping up and testing that 180 resistance right out of the gate we are looking pretty volatile and I am expecting to test that resistance again near open as we gap up.
