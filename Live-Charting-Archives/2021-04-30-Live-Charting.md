Good Morning!

Another day of testing 180 could be ahead of us. I guess we will have to see how badly the 7,188 open calls @ $200 strike want to get paid today. Could be interesting.

Again Your support has meant the world to me over this last week. I am so amazed at what we have accomplish not only on YouTube but yesterday these post almost made it to the front page. Hopefully we will have even more visibility today. You guys have been so amazing in upvoting and awarding these posts. Thank you so much.

Important: please remember that if you haven't contact your broker about your proxy information, you should do so immediately! Not only, are you the owner of a business, but these actions could trigger a share recall by GameStop in order to verify the accuracy of their count. This is a major catalyst...

We will be livestreaming here starting at 9am

Edit 17 3:28

Bounce on that descending support could see price action on volume. Still just sideways low volume looks like the week will end between 172-180. I'll update any dramatic change.

Edit 16 3:05

Power Hour? Slow drift downward we could close as low as 172.5 at this rate

Edit 15 2:38

Nothing happening we broke out of that descending but just more chop above 175

Edit 14 1:55

Descending channel these usually break up. Still consolidating from that last test hitting resistance @ 175 is not out of the question.

Edit 13 1:37

Broke VWAP could head down to 175 again. Burned out the bull side on the 180 test.

Edit 12 1:23

Triple top/ weak head and shoulder. Looks like we've exhausted the attempted push of 180 I can see a dip to VWAP and consolidation before testing again.

Edit 11 12:56

The gravitational pull of 180 is strong

Edit 10 12:42

Looking like a failed breakthrough but we will see if the bulls want to hold the line or not could break back to VWAP

Edit 9 12:03

Still running towards that 180 this ascending channel looks strong but the volume is low I would expect it to spike if we hope to clear 180. I think bull side will push for 200 between now and 3pm in order to capture some of the $ from those $200 Calls

Edit 8 11:30

Bull flag. This can run on volume but without support they usually break to the downside

Edit 7 11:12

Moving up to test VWAP earlier than I expected if we get carried by volume we could even test 180 otherwise expect a rejection at VWAP and more chop

Edit 6 10:49

Weak bounce at 175 could take a while to retest 180

Edit 5 10:39

Volume backed downtrend could hit as low as 169-172

Edit 4 10:22

Weak breakout volume is low but way better than yesterday sitting around 1.5MM

Small descending wedge looking to break up and test again

Edit 2 9:43

Nice early test of 180. Looks like not enough momentum to push through but this is a region I like to be in. If we break the line will update immediately.

Edit 1 9:32

If stays steady we could see a AM test of 180, 66k on opening candle

Pre-market Analysis

Pre-Edit 1 8:45

There was a small gap down which it appears that we are in the process of filling. The volume is low but could pick up in pre-market after 9:00.
