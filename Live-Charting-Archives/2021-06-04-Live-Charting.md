A Merry Friday to you Superstonk!

The news was sure to notify me three times this morning that the squeeze is over and the SEC needs to tell me, a completely uneducated investor, what I can and can't do with my money. This could be the most bullish TA I've seen all week. If the news is still sweating the "momentous force of retail buying power" then clearly this isn't over yet. They aren't wrong if you consider that each long positions is technically a $ ‚àû glitch from SHFs pockets.

I guess they tried to fuk the wrong apes...

Weekend Wrap-Up

Closed slightly below those 250c options but overall an excellent week with max pain sitting at around 222.5-227.5 bull side won again this week. I super excited for next Monday as we draw closer to several potential catalysts. Relax and enjoy your weekend! I will see all you lovely apes bright and early first thing Monday Morning. Thank you all so much for the support as always.

Taking advantage of the low volume in an attempt to push those 250c out of the money...

Edit 7 2:32

These are the 2 breakout points I'm looking at the lower is the weekly bull flag upper resistance that will be much harder. The upper is an intraday consolidating wedge. If we fail these we will remain probably just under that Upper Flag resistance and trade slightly down towards 250 to close.

Edit 6 1:53

Retest lower resistance here and bounce

DFV Said not to push but the wedge says to push it soon

Edit 4 1:05

Still just consolidating

Edit 3 11:53

If this head and should breaks below 255 it will likely test 250. Price action getting very erratic as bid/ask spread is pretty significant. Volatility is picking up.

Edit 2 10:45

Test of 260 failed could go all the way back down volume still non-existant but I'm pretty happy closing the week between 250-260 max pan is at 230 so they may try to drive it down toward 242.5 towards the end of the day

Edit 1 10:00

Under a million volume looking like it's gonna be a slow day so far. tested 260 couldn't hold possibly a bounce off 252.50

Pre-Market Analysis

Not to much in pre-market had a small gap down that was immediately filled. Volume is much lower than an other day this week. SSR is triggered but that could prove to be irrelevant. However opening above VWAP could be the start of a bullish trend for the morning.

[![r/Superstonk - Jerkin' it with Gherkinit S2 E7 Live Charting for 6/4/2021](https://preview.redd.it/zg9v1qxrt8371.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=82d588ce2c90c00c6fb87d71e34463e1a31ecd7b)](https://preview.redd.it/zg9v1qxrt8371.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=82d588ce2c90c00c6fb87d71e34463e1a31ecd7b)

1m timescale

It's possible we fill the 275-290 drop from the day before yesterday as longs push to get the massive wall of of calls at $300 strike ITM

5M timescale

Lastly on the 4hr we still look like we are staying within the weeks expected bull flag --> consolidation --> bull flag pattern. That lower purple line represents our long term support I'd don't expect to dip below it
