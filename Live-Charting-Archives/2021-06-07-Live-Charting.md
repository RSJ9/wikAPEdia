Rise and Shine Superstonk!

I hope everyone is ready for another super exciting day for watching lines on screen, drawing pickles, and contemplating their existence with your favorite professional pickle.

I expect to get a flood of questions from the DD yesterday and a few people wishing to learn the ways of VWAP...

But as always I'm excited and I hope you are too.

After Market Pickle Time!

Beautiful close right at the 280 resistance hopefully we can open tomorrow just above 300 lol ....But looking great on the first part of our weekly flag formation I suspect we will see the 300 test tomorrow . Thank you to all of you tuning in today your support is always appreciated. Also a special thanks to Dillionidas for pushing us towards 300. See you tomorrow at 9am EDT.

Edit 1 9:48

Little late I was confirming the crossover of 260 looking good but definitely another low volume day 780k traded with 200k shorts borrowed.

Pre-Market Analysis

Small fill in the pre-market carrying us just above 250. Volume is moderate at 45k with 81 shares on Iborrow and 883k on Fidelity. Looks like a slow morning so far, but this could pick up as we approach opening bell. I still expect we can continue consolidating to around 242.50 before noon. If we cross that upper resistance band of the bull flag on the 4hr we may see our breakout to the upside this week sooner rather than later.
