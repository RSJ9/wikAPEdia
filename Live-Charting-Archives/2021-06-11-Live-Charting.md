Good Morning Superstonk!

I hope everyone is well rested and ready for what I think will prove to be a volatile day. I had some weird reddit outages yesterday in my region I'm sorry if you guys feel like I left you hanging at any point. I have no reason to believe yesterday's price action was the result of any kind of coordinated short attack or paper-handing. While some shorting did occur, about 51% of shares traded, it was still the least amount this week by percentage .

We will have to wait for shares outstanding to update. Having been involved in other institutional share dilutions in the past, this looks a lot like a significant number of shares are being sold at a rate that maintains a cost-average. We could also see this methodical selling yesterday based on OBV and VWAP indicators.

While this is still considered speculative due to no declaration of sale being released this pattern does indicate large institutional selling. This does not reflect retail selling patterns that we have previously see on this stock.

Friday Happy Hour

Well GME closed up, only $22 below max pain. I'm still operating under the assumption that GME has sold it's ATM offering on to the market I think the sale was finished around 11:45 today which appears to be confirmed by OBV and VWAP. Still we will have to wait T+2 for confirmation. I will be assuming the sale as I readjust the TA analysis this weekend to show the fundamental change. Thank you all again for the support, today was definitely crazy... I will see you all bright and early Monday morning at 9am. Have a great weekend apes!

Edit 6 12:56

Ok if we can pull above 230 we will be nicely out of that downward hedging pressure. Welcome back to VWAP

Edit 5 12:17

Slow bounce off 206 might be on an uptrend the put interest is very high today trying to drive the price down with delta hedging. Ideally we can stay above 210 if we hit 200 just remember buy the dip and hodl

Edit 4 11:13

3300 puts open at 220 so expect this dip to be decent as those move ITM

Looking for a breakout to the upside on this small intraday wedge. Possibly another test of 242.50

Edit 1

Nice volume so far at 2.8 million traded. Looks like we failed a test of 235 but the first 15 min action looks pretty bullish let's see if we can squeak back some of those losses from yesterday.

Pre-Market Analysis

Edit 1: Possible low @ 200 a return to our previous patter requires we cross 250 today.

While the amount of arbitrage I expected was a bit lackluster we are still up in the pre-market currently 6/4% trading @ 234.50. We have traded 225k volume so far. I think we'll have a pretty busy day.

I also must admit if the share sale is correct there is no way TA of any kind could have predicted this movement. Hence the failure of every major TA indicator on this sub yesterday some came close but close is still wrong. I currently Expect us to bounce back into our long-term trend if we do not I will have to do some re-evaluation over the weekend. Even if we do this deviation will have to be factored in but for now.
