Good Morning Superstonk !

Well today we've got 002 apparently in full effect, this one dude who is jacked AF about Ryan Cohen and something T+?, and Strawberry Super Moons. I'm ready to draw some lines on charts and possibly add some new pickles to the Pickle Cinematic Universe.

Oh and today is short interest reporting day for FINRA and the S&P 600 Reconstitution

After Market

Another mostly sideways day we had that nice run up in the morning but even power hour continued flat today. Possibility T+21 was delayed a day I guess we'll find out tomorrow. We still remain well within the predicted cup and handle trend. Thank you all for the support and sorry for so few updates there just wasn't a lot to say.

Breaking down from the days trend possible intraday low if it continues some short volume already coming in on the trend

Pre-Market Analysis

GME has more catalysts today than you can shake a stick at, but pre-market volume is looking pretty low as of right now at around 52k , 290k shares borrowed at 6am so we may see a small dip at open if volume stays low. I'd like to see another early morning test of 225.20 and get above that ATM offering price.

Still no BBKC fire signal on this but everything else is right on track
