A lot of stuff went down last week a possible* ATM offering of 5M shares, new chairman and CEO/CFO announcements, and¬†[I lost a bet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV_Mf7SbA34&t=1s).

I'm looking to see if we move up into that previous exponential growth channel or we form a new one today. I will also be paying pretty close attention to the bond market and SPY this week as those are looking pretty unstable.

After Market

Well that was a weird day decent volume traded but basically no indication that they were still in the process of selling shares at least on the indicators possible that larger investors are waiting to make a move after the ATM announcement. I guess we'll see what happens tomorrow maybe more sideways.

Also did the SPY just do a short squeeze? I didn't see this on this weekends list of WSBs pump and dumps...

Still chopping on VWAP I wish I had more to say about this but the volume seems tied up elsewhere today

Small breakout testing VWAP volume is still crap but maybe it will pick up later today. Bigger buyers will most likely wait for the ATM announcement before making any moves.

Volume very low, we had a breakout from that wedge after the dip but it looks like that triangle from Friday is gonna fail

Classic GME short-breakout

Pre-Market Analysis

We might be opening the day on a breakout of this ascending triangle which could be a nice start to my expected climb for today. Pre-market volume still low at 83k while I write this. 1.2M shares available to borrow between Fidelity and Iborrow. No notable arbitrage.
