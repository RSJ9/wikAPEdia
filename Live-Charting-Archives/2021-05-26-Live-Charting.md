Good Morning Newly Minted Thousandaires!

How does it feel to have that extra $40 dollars of hedgie money per share in your bank account? It feels great! But we aren't done yet, we want more, lots more. Why? because, you made us wait four months. Maybe, we will squeeze them for just as long?

Remember that as this begins to pop off, remember the systemic corruption, greed, and nepotism that allowed this to happen in the first place.

Remember 2008, the reason many of us have never owned a home and instead live in a feudal landowner serf system.

Remember that paycheck that didn't pay you what are worth.

Remember the news articles you've had to read every day telling you "10 better things to do with your money than invest in GME"

Remember if all the economies of the world fail, GME has it's own currency.

Remember these things before you ever consider making a deal.

Every ape is worth millions.

We will never forget the taste of that sweet, sweet mayo!

After Market Notes

Closed slightly above that 240 resistance. Like I said earlier that fight for 250 is going to be pretty fierce as 4k options will go ITM if we cross. We are still continuing that steady upward trend. Waiting for FOMO to go into full effect. I expect the rest of the week will continue to be interesting as we pick up more positive news from MSM.

Thank you all again for the support see you bright and early tomorrow at 9am EST.

Either forming a massive head and shoulders or we are gonna start to see some action soon as we cross over VWAP. 18.67 million volume and we are trading the same as 2 weeks ago the battle for 250 is gonna be a hard one.

Edit 5 12:59

Dipping a bit below VWAP this pattern looks really similar to yesterday I still expect another test of 250 by EOD

Edit 4 12:06

Failed the test of 250 but the ascending channel is continuing as buy pressure outweighs sell side.

Edit 3 11:14

Still fighting for 240 but looking great for the day the options chain IV is really high still but beginning to level off. Sitting at 11.87M traded I expect some volatility in the afternoon.

Edit 2 10:23

Looks like a double bottom if we can break that resistance on VWAP 250 is in the cards

Edit 1 9:58

Sideways on pretty high volume a break above VWAP will probably mean a test of the 250 resistance. If we break down I could see a fill back to 210-215. Volume at 6.74M.

Pre-Market Analysis

Steady climb in after hours currently trading at 226.50, on 300k volume (NASDAQ) this is the kind of pre-market action that leads me to believe that we will be entering the next phase of this soon. Expect a wild open 250k shares available to borrow on Iborrow and more on Fidelity. SHFs have some ammo they will use it. Will it do anything, I doubt it.

We got our first green signal after 18 trading days as the price moves outside of the BBKC channel this is about to go boom.

TTM and BBKC on the 1D

Remember our old buddy CV VWAP well it's back and there is just about enough arbitrage for the us to tap that signal line
