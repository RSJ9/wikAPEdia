Good Morning Superstonk!

It's me "pickle guy" here to bring you another day of drawing pickles and triangles on the charts while watching GME trade sideways.

Well maybe not, according to a lot of very lightly researched information we get to find out who the DTCC cares more about today themselves or the markets they are supposed to "self-regulate". I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess themselves.

Possibly however we could see some smaller GME short positions move on the regulations as they are less well connected and more likely to get steamrolled by incoming regulations. Usually when these types of regulation go into effect they are enforced at a lower level so as to give the appearance of doing their job without actually targeting any of the big boys like Citadel. Low-hanging fruit if you will. Absolute speculation, just an interesting thought.

JPOW said liftoff at least 12x, GME positive now on the daily

Triple bottom bounce into a test of VWAP

Edit 5 12:37

Looks like we might be going back down to 210-212. Volume dried up another sideways day unless JPOW crashes the market

Edit 4 11:21

1.1 million shares back on iborrow borrow fee dropped to 0.7% this could be long funds putting up shares from the ATM offering that they just purchased. I do believe that the current rebate rate is .98% however so it looks like GME is now +0.2% positive to short borrow...Fell below VWAP more chop if we slip the support expect a dip

Edit 2 10:15

Nice double bottom bounce looks like most of the shares borrowed are eaten up already based on volume ratio. If that was all their ammo this was a pretty pathetic short attack.

Edit 1 9:46

500k volume so far. Didn't hold VWAP so we may see a bit of a dip but surprisingly stable given the number of shares borrowed

Pre-Market Analysis

Pre-Edit 4 9:21

Now the shares on iborrow are gone down to 10,000 available. So a total of 1.19M borrowed.

Pre-Edit 3 9:08

700k borrowed Iborrow now at 500k available.

Pre-Edit 2 9:00

Still looks like those shares were borrowed strap in it could get ugly

Pre-Edit 1

We could definitely have another nothing morning our volume is low sitting at 32k. It appears that the 1.2 million shares have disappeared from Iborrow, I'll update more on this before market open. Fidelity is showing 1M shares available but also flagged as "hard to borrow". If they have been borrowed we could see some crazy opening price action so be prepared. Pretty flat pre-market so far. I will drop another update around 9-9:15 after I get some more information on share availability.
