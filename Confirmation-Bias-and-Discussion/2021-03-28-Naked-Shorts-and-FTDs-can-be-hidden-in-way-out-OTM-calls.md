Edit: wow... I didn't expect this to get THIS much traction, but thank you. Save your awards for GME, and keep looking for hiding spots. The numbers are hard time process, so I appreciate all the great REAL DD that goes on here.

I don't want to call this DD, as it is not yet proven, but I think it is worth discussing. I am no advisor, nor a mongoose. Read everything with hefty skepticism.

After reading this article linked here, I think I now understand a bigger picture. I've been working to determine the SI (as I know MANY people have) and of course run into the same problems..... So much of the officially published numbers make absolutely no sense with what we already know to be true.

Something is wrong. Muckery is afoot!

Then I see this.

This is an article from 2012, after the 2008 crash!! It outlines some basics, but one thing it revealed is that naked shorts and FTDs could be hidden (they called it CONVERTED) in waaaay out-there OTM calls.

If their short position has been CONVERTED then they no longer have to report it as short.

Which is why the numbers look funky low.... But Hedgies are still scrambling, FUDding and threatening. It explains why FINRA data looks so high, even though short positions are (a week later) reported as low.

FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS DECENT, please stop buying and using options!!!! It gives the Hedgies a place to hide their short positions and makes things so much harder and worse for the retail investor.
