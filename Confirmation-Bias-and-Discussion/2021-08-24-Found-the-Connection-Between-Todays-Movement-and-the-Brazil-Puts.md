I was watching the order list today as price was moving and i noticed block orders from an exchange EDGX were pouring in thousands at a time. I took this screencap later so at the time there weren't as many, Imagine that 2k block order but filling half the feed

It peaked my interest, so I did some digging on trusty Wiki

Anything stick out to you? Last two companies to take ownership of said exchange are.....CITADEL AND GOLDMAN SACKS. Not only that but the Exchange is operated in.......... Rio de Janeiro, Brazil!

Coincidence?

Y'all tell me.

Edit: If this holds up, it means AT LEAST Bloomberg is colluding with Citadel. Their excuse about the "bug" should be held against them.

Edit 2: Prior to his career in the federal government, Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs, where he was a partner and co-head of finance.

The¬†[Brazilian requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/parhth/are_shfs_trying_to_get_around_the_isda_phase_5/)¬†for ISDA's Phase 5 reporting are NOT the same as the U.S. requirements. Brazil had 1 transaction we saw from Citadel at an¬†[undisclosed dollar value](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otzu3e/posting_some_more_info_to_help_wrinkle_brains/). They might be unloading enough to get below the reporting threshold for 2021. That's what's been bugging me all day.
