[Possible DD üë®‚Äçüî¨](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Possible%20DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

Introduction

For the longest time I have been looking into historic data regarding the lowest price and the highest price for each trading day the past couple of months. I can confirm with this possible DD? (Correct me if not.) that the tables are indeed turning into our favor sooner or later.

In this analysis I will focus on why the data is confirming a breakthrough in upward momentum soon. Judging by the graph it is easy to see that the price has seen forced negative price action by HF's. My data is showing that they have limited recourses to press the price down, and its very telling by comparing the lowest price of the day, to the highest price of the day by using exponential regression.

To put it short. The floor is increasing, and nothing had worked for the hedge funds (Whoops Sorry not sorry Ken).

Disclaimer:

1.  It is likely that I make a lot of spelling errors in this post. Feel free to correct me. Feedback is very much appreciated.

2.  I am not a professional data analyst, nor am I claiming my points as objective truth, I'm simply an ape that like the stock.

3.  It is entirely possible that it turns out to speculation. It would not surprise me, since GME have a record to be unpredictable. But it is fun to speculate, nonetheless. I therefor ancourage you to take this post with a grain of salt. Use this as you wish.

4.  Keep in mind that I'm a Europoor. I use a European version of excel, that's why you see ","s where "."s should be.

5.  I'm not that good at exceptional regression.

Goal:

- I wanted to compare the lowest price to the highest price from each day since feb 19th to see when the breakthrough is going to happen.

- I'm using exponential regression and comparing when the breakthrough is going to happened.

- The breakthrough could maybe indicate that the hedge funds are drying up, and cant keep the price down anymore (I want to hear what you guys think as well, so we all can become smarter)

Data collection:

I used data from¬†[Yahoo finance, GME history](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/)

The reason I picked Feb. 19th as a start date is because it is the lowest the price since the spike in January (38.5$). I do not want to use pre-January data because it would not give a clear picture of the price suppression.

Since February 19th there has been 70 trade days (yes that long ago). As seen on the data and by looking at the graph it is easy to see that its not possible to push the price further down since then.

Outcast of the data:

I manually typed the numbers in. But I checked it twice and it seems like there aren't any typing errors.

Data input 1: Highest price for each day since Feb. 19th

[![r/Superstonk - The tables will turn](https://preview.redd.it/ndacoud3hg271.png?width=2613&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e5f212f9c22aec7cebff2ffee0e375eea45884)](https://preview.redd.it/ndacoud3hg271.png?width=2613&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e5f212f9c22aec7cebff2ffee0e375eea45884)

It is a bit hard to see, but the floor is slowly rising exponentially, showing by the dotted line.

Important note:¬†R^2 (a way to tell how reliable the numbers are) is only 0.2, i belive it is low because it indicate a organic upward momentum. Normal stocks are unprededible in their nature to some estenct. By looking into forced negative pressure it shows thats in not organic nor natural, therefor the R^2 regarding highest price for each day is closer to 1.

Data input 2: Lowest price for each day since Feb. 19th

[![r/Superstonk - The tables will turn](https://preview.redd.it/w5zsp7h5hg271.png?width=2612&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bd2738196f6fd390a83dcfe90dc6fc4a6bbc04)](https://preview.redd.it/w5zsp7h5hg271.png?width=2612&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bd2738196f6fd390a83dcfe90dc6fc4a6bbc04)

As seen, it is also rising at a steady pace, by a factor of 0.0038x more than the highest price for the day. Therefor the floor is getting closer and closer to the highest price. It indicates that we are keeping up regarding the forced negative price action.

Comparing data (Speculatory breakthrough date):

-   "Highest" = From Highest price on x day

-   "Lowest" = From Lowest price on x day

Datasets 1 and 2 + breakthough point

x = Day 78 y = Price

-   Breakthrough¬†= (78.28, 214.72)

As seen on the graph above it shows that the highest price will cross the lowest price on day¬†x78, at price 214$. It indicate that the Hedge funds are drying up and cannot keep doing what they do.

Conclusion:

June the 10th is the day that the breakthrough is going to happen (accorting to exponential regression, dont take it as truth).¬†It is day 78x as seen on the chart. The hedge funds do not have any more recourses to keep the price down and therefor the tables are turning into o
