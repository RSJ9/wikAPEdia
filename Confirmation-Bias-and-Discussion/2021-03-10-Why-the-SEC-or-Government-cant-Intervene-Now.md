Edit: Disclaimer: I have heard from multiple people that it's possible that these could be the result of a glitch. I have seen similar glitches before, but usually only for a single bar/candle. Not dozens over the span of an hour, and across multiple platforms. I will ask around and look into this further and update if I can acquire any more information. For now, take this analysis with numerous grains of salt, but also know that this does not change my psychological conclusions regarding potential SEC/government action. But I would be remiss to not update this as more info arises.

Alright listen up, y'all. If you don't have an aneurysm halfway through, you might just end up with a couple extra wrinkles.

Okay fine, I'll preface this by admitting that, technically, the SEC/gov could still intervene. But it would be an extraordinarily bad idea. If you've read any of my previous stuff, you know I love me some Moneyball, and to quote Jonah Hill: "This is the kind of decision that gets you fired."(<https://youtu.be/CR_yS6IxB-c>) I genuinely believe that today we experienced an inflection point so egregious, so blatant, that anyone on the side of the shorts in this trade will be committing career suicide.

Most of my due diligence revolves around market psychology, and I rarely delve into technical analysis, as I'm of the mind that it usually only serves to tell you how much you don't know rather than anything actionable, but in this case I'm gonna make an exception, so let's kick this off with some numbers before we dive into the touchy-feely bullshit. In the immortal words of Nickelback, "LOOK AT THIS GRAAAAPH"

Notice anything funny? I sure hope so, because I have never, in my life, seen anything quite like it. What you're seeing here, to use scientific terminology, is the stock market equivalent of a mother slapping her petulant child and yelling "KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF."

While it's possible there were some retail paper hands exiting during this insanity, all signs point to this being an all-out war between the shorts and their big brothers and whales that are on our side of this trade. What you're seeing here is a small number of institutions viciously duking it out. There is some compelling info floating around that some whales were assisting the shorts around noon, as evidenced by the quick turnaround right after the drop, but that was to be expected. When you look at what starts taking place around 2:00, that's when things get interesting.

That first green candle screams "hurr hurr we can do this shit too, we'll put it right back to where you started shorting," followed by a temper tantrum represented by the first giant red candle. The gap between that first exchange and the shitstorm that follows is likely explained by the big boys that are long going "Really? REALLY? Okay then, free up some capital, it's on now." Then all hell breaks loose. Massive (for a one-on-one battle, not normal hourly volume), rapid, aggressive high-frequency trading that you can't make heads or tails of, other than the most important detail (and the only one that matters): The tops and bottoms of these candles mostly line up.

How I interpret this:

Institutional longs are fed the fuck up. They are saying without saying, in no uncertain terms, "Cut it the fuck out. It doesn't matter how long this DTCC rule change takes, because until then we'll hold you accountable for your fuckery." People have been explaining for weeks now that in an unprecedented scenario such as this, price simply does not matter, and this is a perfect example. The real price during that time of extreme volatility is the stock market equivalent of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The real price of the stock for that 45 minute window is essentially any price along any of those bars. It only becomes real when you observe it, and not too many of us have a Bloomberg terminal just chilling in the living room. So, for now, it would be prudent not to attribute any level of importance to price alone. You're far better served looking for DD about more tangible data than anything having to do with charts or technical analysis.

So what's this mean for us?

In the video I linked above, the SEC (played by Brad Pitt) states: "It's a problem you think we have to explain ourselves. Don't. To anyone." A fine sentiment....but only as long as you're right. In most cases, being on the wrong side of history will end up biting you in the ass, and this is no exception. As I've said countless times before, this is not 2008. 2008 did not transpire in real-time. 2008 did not have the eyes of the world upon it. 2008 was a post-mortem, and by the time people figured out what the fuck just happened, they were too busy worrying about where their next meal was gonna come from. Well, sorry, we're stuck inside with nothing better to do, waiting on pitiful stimulus checks, and we already have decades of getting creative with Top Ramen under our belts.

It's one thing to try to explain why this situation is unprecedented using spreadsheets of short interest data or long-since-forgotten short squeeze comparisons. It's another to be able to point at a graph and say "EVER SEEN SOME SHIT LIKE THAT BEFORE?" This is just the latest in a months-long string of manipulation, disinformation, lying, and outright fraud, but it's easily one of the most damning. Any idiot can take one glance at that and realize it's like nothing they've ever seen. They may not give a fuck until half their portfolio disappears, but when it does, they're gonna start asking questions.

I've been saying for a while now that I don't think the SEC/Government understands the implications of what they're dealing with here. It would be truly insane for them to intervene on the side of the hedge funds, but I considered it a much higher probability before today. This wild graph perfectly encapsulates the danger posed by ruling the wrong way on this one. 2008 was strike one, January was strike two, and this would be a colossal strike three. The institutions on the long side with us are signaling very clearly that they agree. Not only would perpetuating the myth of fairness in our markets be deadly to retail investment, possibly forever, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if big players like Blackrock, Vanguard, and Fidelity sent their business elsewhere.

TLDR: Even the SEC and government should now be able to recognize that the squeeze is good for everyone except the shorts (except Steve Cohen who's fat as shit and could use a nice lil squizzle). HODL, you magnificent bastards. No matter how this shakes out, it will go down as one of the most monumental economic events of the century. Hopefully the SEC/government recognize this, because if not, well....this has the markings of a complete paradigm shift all over it.

Edit 2: As far as what this would all look like, I couldn't have said it better than¬†[/u/Dense-Seaweed7467](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dense-Seaweed7467/):¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2asru/death_throes_dd_the_secgovernment_cant_intervene/gqipqu6>

This will either go down one of two ways within the history books.

The greatest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen. A few hedge funds and market managers get liquidated. Millions are made into new millionaires overnight. A few billionaires. The first trillionaire. Overnight the economy, specifically local businesses, get a stimulus shot in the arm as newly enriched retail starts spending money long withheld in stagnant treasure hoards. During the next tax season the US Government pays off not only the $1.9 Trillion anti-covid bill it just passed, but perhaps a massive chunk of the deficit (if not the entire thing). How trading is conducted is investigated and hopefully overhauled for the better (speculation on that one right?).

Or.

The government gets involved on the wrong side and does not let the squeeze go through. People all over the world are left furious, as are some institutions who were in on the side of the squeeze. The US market is exposed to be blatantly corrupt and all trust in it is shattered. Instead the market moves elsewhere, as do many institutions. People, already at their wits end from Covid and a myriad of other things over the past year, finally reach the breaking point. Perhaps we finally see a real class war in the US. The rich are devoured. Viva la revolucion!

But who knows. All I know is this: GME to $500,000+! Doubled for every week they put this off!

Edit: Please no awards. GME is more important, and other DD better deserves the free ones.
