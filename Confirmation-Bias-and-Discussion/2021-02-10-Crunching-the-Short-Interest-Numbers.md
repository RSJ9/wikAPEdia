Gather round, diamond handed apes and crayon eating retards. There is a lot of confusion about what short interest from the short interest report today actually means. Here is how it breaks down.

Today's reported short interest is 78.46. Short Interest is the percentage of short shares of the outstanding shares. Outstanding shares means ALL the shares of the stock, including restricted shares and shares held by insiders.

GME has 69,750,000 outstanding shares. 78.46% of those outstanding shares is 54,725,850 shares. So as of the settlement date of 1/29 there were 54,725,850 shorted shares out there that need to be covered. By comparison, the number of shorted shares from the 1/15 report was 61,780,000 . So since the 1/15 report to the 1/29 only 7,054,150 shorts were covered.

Got it so far? Ok here is the good shit.

Float is the number of shares that are available to trade. Float is the number of outstanding shares minus the restricted shares and the shares held by insiders. GME Float is 46,890,000 .

So the short float percentage is the number of shorted stocks (54,735,850) divided by the float (46,890,000) x 100. So, the SHORT PERCENTAGE OF FLOAT IS 117%.

Thats right, the 1/29 report tells us that the short stocks are 117% of the available GME stock. Did you all hear me?

The next part is the REALLY GOOD SHIT

Let's take a a look at the 7,054,150 shorts that were covered between the 1/15 report and the 1/29 report. The short interest report from 1/29 is from the SETTLEMENT date, not the trading date. It takes two days for settlement, so the short interest you see is actually from trading through 1/27. Likewise, the 1/15 report is from trading through 1/13.

Ok, according to todays report, 7,054,150 shorts were covered between 1/13 and 1/27. So what happened during that period?

On 1/13 GME opened at 20.42 and closed at 31.40. On January 27 GME closed at 347.51. That is an increase of 327.09. That is an increase of just over 1600%!

Of course, everyone knows what happened on the following day. The price shot up to 450, the DTC increased margins and shut down retail buyers.

Only 7,054,150 shares were covered during that 1600% increase in GME stonks. Some of that increase must have been due to people jumping on the bandwagon so the increase probably isn't completely due to the short squeeze that had started.

TLDR: The Short Interest Report today shows us that on there was 112% more shares shorted than were actually available to purchase on 1/27/21. Between 1/13 and 1/27 on about 7 million shorts were covered.

The hedges are fucked. They have been shorting like crazy since 1/27 because they were really bleeding by that point. They had to keep the price down and try to reduce retail purchases and holdings by all the shit we have seen in the subs, on twitter and tv.

Nothing has changed, the squeeze has not happened yet.

Buy Hold. Peace

GUYS I SOLVED IT! I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THIS

<https://imgur.com/a/0C748cH>

look at the difference in volume as of today.

THIS IS JUST TODAY

<https://www.theoptionsguide.com/synthetic-long-call.aspx>

Now this is what a synthetic long call is

This is what a synthetic long call is. Basically. When you short a stock. You are take 100 shares and selling them from an institution even if you dont have them. You have to cover that 100 shares at some point.

however. If you make another contract to -buy- 100 shares. You have in effect cancelled out your 100 shares you sold. Because you wrote a contract to buy 100 shares.

Now! Look at this

<https://www.ortex.com/symbol/NYSE/GME/short_interest>

The ortex short interest has been falling all last week along with the price. When GME is falling 100$ who is going to be looking at 800$ calls

which tells me that they have been buying 800$ call this whole time in order to cancel out their short positions. Because as the stock price falls those 800$ are going to get dirt cheap. Even when GME was going up 800$ were like 4$

i even have proof of one of the HFs doing it!

<https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme>

look at seqouia or whatever.

they have like 1.8 million puts and over 6 million calls

I am trying to get this out there for people to see!
