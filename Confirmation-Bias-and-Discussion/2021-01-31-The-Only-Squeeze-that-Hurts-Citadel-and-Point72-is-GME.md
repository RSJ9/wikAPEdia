You are being played: Citadel and Point72--major hedge funds and investors in Melvin--own tons of AMC, NOK, and BB. The only squeeze that hurts them is GME ðŸš€

*Edit as of May 27th, 2021*: I posted this back in something like January of this year. Stop commenting on it. Of course things have changed since then. But the price action you saw in AMC today was not shorts covering, it was options driven. Take a look at call volume today.

The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase.

I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted toÂ [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/)Â prior to GME. We're wallstreet*bets*Â after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.

After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:

This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well.

Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK.

BB

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb), Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.

AMC

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc)Â (Ctrl+F citadel or point72), Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase.

NOK

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/nok), Citadel owns an enormous 2,950,823 shares of, call options on, and put options on NOK, and Point72 does not own shares of NOK. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.

We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.

*The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME***.**Â *These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).*

Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?

The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively,Â *some*Â hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.

TLDR:Â hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK.Â BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES. GME TO THE MOON ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Disclaimer: I am retarded and not a financial advisor, so this isn't financial advice. I am long GME and not long any of the other positions mentioned in this post (for the reasons I have outlined in this post). I also regularly scrub my post history but have been on this subreddit long enough to be a member of tanker gang.

EDIT: READ THE HUGE EDIT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS POST YOU RETARDS, THIS POST IS OLDER THAN YOU.
