TL;DR: Apes can get tendies. No doomsday for world economy. Ook ook. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Who pays the apes?

Let's take a look at the chain of failures. Short hedgies go broke trying to pay the apes with shares. Their positions are transferred to their creditors, the big banks. What happens when they don't have enough money? They go to the lender of last resort, in this case, the Federal Reserve. Here's a video on it:

The last time this happened was in 2008, when among others, AIG latched onto the Federal tit for a massive bailout and later paid hundreds of millions in bonuses to the very department that triggered the bailout. Seriously, this happened: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIG_bonus_payments_controversy>

If any of you XX or higher shareholders out there are holding past $218 million in payouts as a symbolic gesture, just remember, you deserve it more than AIG. Anyone who says otherwise can go play leapfrog with unicorns.

How much will the Fed need to print?

According to this DD on Geometric Mean: <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations_for_the_total_payout_of_gme_based_on/>

Around 5 trillion dollars at the $20 million a share range, averaged out for paper hands along the way. Assuming that 20% of the ownership is outside of America, that leaves 4 trillion going into the domestic economy. But wait! Taxes. 2 trillion goes to apes, 2 trillion goes to the treasury. If I was the ruling party, 2 trillion dollars with no strings attached to advance my party's interests would be pretty sweet, another reason why doing nothing is the best approach. The budgetary spending for 2020 was 4.79 trillion dollars. This windfall would be worth around 41.8% of their budget. Imagine if the government was an average person, 41.8% of what they spend for the year is a small jackpot but not life changing. It is definitely not enough to be considered hyperinflation. Assuming that 80% of this subreddit is American shareholders, this works out to be 240,000 shareholders / 331 million people = 0.0725% of the population. Spreading the payout around such a small group of people will not have a huge effect on the consumer price index or put a lot of pressure on demand, unless you are considering fringe categories like Lambos and McLarens.

Won't all this money ruin the economy?

NO! According to the Fed data gathered by Forbes, the top 1% of Americans have a combined net worth of 34.2 trillion dollars: <https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/10/08/top-1-of-us-households-hold-15-times-more-wealth-than-bottom-50-combined/?sh=5b0c5c835179>

The top 1% own 43% of the world's wealth, totaling over 173.3 trillion dollars in 2019: <https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/>

With the geometric mean, the top 1% of wealth in America will increase by 5.8%. On a global scale, 3 trillion dollars after taxes is a 1.7% increase. The payout will register a small blip, and those who paper hand early may not even make the cut for the top 1%. What does this conclude? Fears of an ape payout causing hyperinflation is FUD. The payout causing global hyperinflation or massive distortion of the world's wealth is FUD. Don't hold for a number that seems big to you. Hold for a number that seems big to THEM. Even if the number of diamond hands doubles or triples, 9 trillion dollars after taxes is a small ripple in the global supply of wealth. Let's hope some of you apes will know how to create a positive butterfly effect with your tendies.

Edit: [u/Allohn](https://www.reddit.com/u/Allohn/) pointed out this DD here has a more correct Apeish number of 60 trillion:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmt8rh/geometric_mean_exponential_increase_and_gme_price/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share>

How does that change the overall picture? 25 trillion taxes, 25 trillion to apes, 10 trillion abroad. Net impact of 35 trillion. 20.2% increase in the top 1% of worldwide wealth with ultimate diamond hands. Still not enough to pay off the national debt of 28 trillion and counting. Seeing as how M2 is no longer counted, and the true number of shares to be paid out is unknown, I wonder if they can sweep this much money under the rug. Only one way to find out!
