I have accumulated a timeline of the major GME events since the start of the saga and added along some insights. A lot of DD's have focused on the GME short interest, however, I think it is important to have a solid grasp of the sequences of events, so that we can better understand where this might all be headed. This is a long one guys but THERES A LOT OF NICE PICTURES. EAT YOUR FAVORITE CRAYON, HUFF SOME GLUE AND COME DIVE ON IN:

THE START: Q4 2018. Famous investor Michael Burry's hedge fund Scion Capital Discloses first position of GME buying 536,862 shares and then another 113,138 shares by 3/3/19

March 4th 2019: Gamestop announces $300 million stock repurchase program (Total Shares Outstanding 102,457,498)

June 10th 2019: Gamestop buys back 12 million outstanding shares completed by July 2019 ( Total Shares Outstanding: 90,457,598 )

Redditor and deep value investor Keith Gill aka DeepFuckingValue (tracking Burry) decides to jump into the GME game with his first call options purchases starting 6/19 through 9/3/19. Ironically Scion capital sells off their position around this time

July 28th and August 26th 2019. Burry the shareholder is digging in deep down the rabbit hole of GME's inner turmoil: Incompetent board, declining share prices and insane short-selling. He sends a letter out demanding they finish the stock buyback program, but the board is dragging their feet. Again, Scion capital has exited sometime around here

DeepFucking Value seems to agree with Burry's sentiment on the outstanding short position and the benefit of a share buyback. The company's cash flows and future revenue from the upcoming console cycle will give the company plenty of time to turn things around if they are able to seize the opportunity

November 2019: Gamestops quarterly report comes out and it shows that they have bought back 22 million shares (Total Outstanding Share Count: 68,457,598)

<https://imgur.com/uMMtOFU>

December 2019 The float has now been cut down to Burry's delight and Scion Capital buys back into GME repurchasing position to 3 million shares

December 2019 GME stock continues to bleed and bad Q3 earnings report comes out. DeepFuckingValue seeing the real deep fucking value in the smaller float and Scions re-entry adds Febuary 21, April 16, July 17th call options

DeepFuckingValue rides the GME wave through Christmas 2019 and holds strong as he begins to lose about 50% of his investment in Febuary 2020 and COVID is right around the corner.

March 2020: COVID hits. Ouchie. The market dives with the onset of the pandemic and GME falls all the way down to $2.85/share by April 2nd. DeepFuckingValue's balls of steel likely take their hardest hit throughout this saga. The company is heading to bankruptcy and some other shareholders are about to voice their displeasure with management...

April 2rd 2020: THE GAME CHANGES: REBIRTH AND OFFICIAL BEGINNING OF THE SHORT SQUEEZE. Michael Burry's Scion Capital purchases 400,000 shares for total of 3.4 million shares of GME

April 3rd 2020 HESTIA CAPITAL SENDS THIS LETTER TO ALL GAMESTOP SHAREHOLDERS AND DOCUMENTS ALL THE EVIDENCE OF INCOMPETENCE AMONGST THE BOARD. READ THIS IN FULL!!!!!

A private jet....board members being dragged out in public to buy shares of the company they are supposed to be working for and growing...delaying from answering reasonable questions from the shareholders....holy fuck. HESTIA Capital is essentially screaming to shareholders: THE BOARD IS INCOMPETENT AND WERE ARE BEING SHORT SOLD OUT OF BUSINESS. SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING! AND YET THE BOARD DOES NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. *WHY? JUDGE FOR YOURSELF*

GME's stock price surges surges from $2.85/share to $6.47/share from April 3rd to April 14th . Shorts scramble to find stock.

Burry's purchase of GME happens April 2nd however the document doesn't get uploaded to the public until April 10th. DeepFuckingValue hits paydirt and posts his reaction to Reddit.

<https://imgur.com/pueZoz2>

May 2020. Burry loans out his shares to shorts (perhaps to run an experiment just to see *HOW DEEP* the short selling was?)

<https://imgur.com/7MovATA>

Summer 2020: Our Boy DeepFuckingValue's diamond balls hold through significant losses in July...only to see a major pay off thanks to Cohen and Burry in August. DFV officially becomes RC's #1 fan.

August 18th 2020: THE GAME CHANGER. Ryan Cohen (perhaps seeing what Burry and DFV see...and a chunk of sweet sweet CHEWY tendies) enters the game and RC ventures starts buying GME to leverage himself onto the board. He discloses 5.8 million shares August 18th and a total of 6.5 million shares (9% of outstanding shares) August 28th.

GME shares surge after Burry's July and August letters and Cohens massive purchase.

<https://imgur.com/p3i7ZsY>

November 16th 2020. Frustrated with a lack of ability to change the direction of the company as an outside investor. Ryan Cohen submits a scathing letter to Gamestop's Board of Directors to act up or he will initiate a hostile takeover.

After the 11/16/20 Cohen letter Gamestop prices surge again...

<https://imgur.com/TcMe40p>

DeepFuckingValue's <3 for Ryan Cohen just reaches total man crush level and who can blame him. The dudes a total stud and helped him make 3 million dollars worth of gains from July.

<https://imgur.com/iRBYSOu>

GME shares bump 11/16/20 from $12/share to $20/share by 12/22/20

<https://imgur.com/mxC3q4I>

December 17th 2020: Ryan Cohen files document with SEC disclosing he is in talks with Gamestops board and RC ventures now owns 9,001,000 shares (12.9% of outstanding shares)

<https://imgur.com/dgKkdjY>

December 2020. Michael Burry decides to sell his position after seeing Cohen makes his move and GME peak @$22/share December 28th.

Why did Burry sell? That is the million dollar question. He knew about the outstanding short position long before everyone else. He also had fought fruitlessly since 2019 to try and change the direction of the company himself. Despite multiple letters in 2019 urging GME to buy back shares and trigger a squeeze, the same incompetent people were sitting on the board likely helping short sellers bankrupt the company. Seeing an exit with a decent 4-5x profit, Burry decided he'd take what he could. If he couldn't get the companies board to stop killing the company on purpose how could Ryan Cohen? Little did he know a certain redditor had developed quite a following on a certain reddit forum. *..DFV posts this probably just days after Burry exits:*

January 10th 2021: The Unthinkable Happens. Remember that letter Ryan Cohen sent to GME's board November 16th? Well inside that letter if you read it contained this BALLS ON THE TABLE statement:

<https://imgur.com/q4VKhqx>

Fearing a hostile takeover by Ryan Cohen who had newfound power with the stock bump from OG retail investors and DFV..and possibly realizing this dude actually has the skillset to turn this thing around *(and make them richer than the shorts can driving the company into the ground)* Gamestop's board of directors finally do the thing Michael Burry couldn't get them to do: Capitulate. *PUT ON TIN FOIL HAT NOW* ***GAMESTOPS OWN INCOMPETENT BOARD SWITCHES FROM SHORT GME TO LONG GME...***THEY REALIZE THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY SIDING WITH COHEN AND RETAIL INVESTORS (Ahem ...THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS) THAN THEY CAN WITH SHORT SELLERS DRIVING THE COMPANY TO BANKRUPTCY. The board agrees to cede control of 3 seats and a restructure of total seats to 9 by its June 21 annual meeting. In exchange, Cohen agrees to limit ownership of outstanding GME shares to 20% until 2022.

<https://imgur.com/kY7ZDpH>

January 13th 2021. Redditor's catch on to what DFV has been saying for years and upvote his post to over 50k ( a fivefold increase over his previous highs)

<https://imgur.com/CaCt4e1>

And the stock price FUCKING ROCKETS AS FOMO SETS IN AND RETAIL BUYS

<https://imgur.com/hF30wGr>

The rest we all know. I dont need to walk everyone through the events since January 10th. We have all bought in and have been living through them or have read about them. However I do want to highlight one particular event since then: *ICE CREAM COHEN*

Febuary 24th 2021 1:57 PM:

And a massive boost in the share price within a span of the ensuing 3 hours:

IMPORTANT FACTS TO STATE: Lets all agree to the following:

Fact 1: The short squeeze was started by Michael Burry.

Fact 2: DeepFuckingValue acknowledges fact #1 himself

Fact 3: The Board of GME was driving the company into bankruptcy

Fact 4: Without Michael Burry's efforts to pressure the board, the outstanding share total does not decline from 102 million down to 68 million and we have no small float to deliver the potential short squeeze.

Thoughts and Musings:

-If you're a hedge fund trying to bankrupt a company by short-selling it into the ground, it sure would make you much more confident in your scheme (and lower your infinite risk downside) if you knew you had company insiders helping you get to zero. Otherwise, how can you take on such high risk by short selling it as much as they did?

-GME Board members were doing some sketchy shit when there were multiple opportunities for them to act and try and turn around the company.

Some things to ponder after we have reviewed how we got here and who the major players in this story are : (BURRY, COHEN, DFV)

1\. Are we really going to believe that Ryan Cohen tweeted a picture of an ice cream cone 2 hours before GME's price surged from $50 to $166 and it was just a coincidence?

2\. Are we really going to believe that THE Michael Burry....the guy who shorted the housing market crash of 2008....the guy who saw the GME short squeeze opportunity before everyone else and directly led to its inception....hasn't found a way back in the game?

3\. Could Scion Capital be one of our whale friends?

Disclaimer: I am a crayon eating ape. All information contained in this post is publicly available. My thoughts and speculation are not to be interpreted as financial advise and my stated facts are for amusement purposes only. I am not accusing any GME board members of illegal activity. Each individual should think and make their own decisions when it comes to their investments and the information contained in this post.

TLDR: Michael Burry started the short squeeze. DFV has balls of steel and is a genius. Ryan Cohen has his own balls of steel and is also a genius. In fact, Michael Burry is a genius as well. All 3 of these people are geniuses. Gamestop's board appears to have been incompetent in the short strategy of bankrupting GME. Michael Burry stopped it and started the squeeze. Ryan Cohen changed the game. Burry might be our whale friend. We all just like the stock. The squeeze has not been squoze.

Edit: updated scion capitals purchase after float cut down.
