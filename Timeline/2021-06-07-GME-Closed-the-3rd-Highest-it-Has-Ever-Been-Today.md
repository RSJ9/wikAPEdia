Let that sink in...

6/2/21\
$282.24 Close Price\
~16 million volume

6/7/21\
$280.01 Close Price\

Just imagine what the price will be once the rocket takes off and volume actually increases...

Edit2: thanks to [u/flori4ika](https://www.reddit.com/u/flori4ika/) for keeping me honest here. 6/2 closed at $282.24. good catch! so today's close is actually the 4th highest. Still super crazy considering the low volume.
