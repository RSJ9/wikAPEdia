This is the first part of my Key Players series where we take a deep dive into who's who and their role within the GameStop saga. The intent of this series is not to put on my tinfoil hat and connect dots where unnecessary, it is simply to aggregate publicly available information on the internet.

While I have cited multiple sources throughout this DD, take everything with a grain of salt, validate it, and call me out if something is incorrect.
