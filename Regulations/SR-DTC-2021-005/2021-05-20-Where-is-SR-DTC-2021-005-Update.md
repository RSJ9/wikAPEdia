Hello Fellow Apes,

I am writing this post to let Apes know that I was able to follow-up through the SEC and the DTCC on SR-DTC-2021-005 and to the follow-up on work in my initial post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzkf8v/where_is_srdtc2021005/), and providing you now with the status update I received.

I would also like to report that the SEC and the DTCC once again were very gracious and timely in their responses.

For those not familiar with SR-DTC-2021-005 and what it does.

In short, SR-DTC-2021-005 would limit the ability of market makers and hedge funds working together to reset FTD transactions and/or conceal short positions through nefarious options trading.

There are some great DD's on this rule by [u/bigbrainbets](https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbrainbets/) ; [u/lighthouse30130](https://www.reddit.com/user/lighthouse30130/), and others, and good follow-up work by [u/kamayatzee](https://www.reddit.com/u/kamayatzee/) .

Now,

Below is the chain of communication between myself , the SEC, and the DTCC on the whereabouts of SR-DTC-2021-005.
