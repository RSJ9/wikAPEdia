Well given this post has gained some traction and thank you for mentioning, my very simplistic TLDRs for the filings:

Proposed NYSE change: change to the way the NBBO is calculated, which is snooze for GME purposes.

CORRECTION: on looking at another post this may be way more juicy than my skim intended, mayÂ include dark pools and OTC prices in calculating the NBBO, worth a look!

Proposed ICE change: honestly this is out of my wheelhouse as it relates to credit default swaps, so I'd need to take time to do more research

Proposed BZE change: this is quite juicy, seems to want to put aÂ limit on the number of strikes for short term options, may be worth looking into

Proposed CBOE change: same as above, just different exchange

Proposed MEMX change: to extend a pilot program till October 21 relating to 'clearly erroneous executions', again probably worth a look

Proposed NASDAQ BX change: proposal to improve its display of what the highs, lows and close price of a security was for that day

Proposed NASDAQ PHLX change: same as above, different exchange

Please note this is a 5 minute skim of each doc as I'm knee deep in my new DD and unfortunately can't spare the time to look in great detail, hope this helps though
