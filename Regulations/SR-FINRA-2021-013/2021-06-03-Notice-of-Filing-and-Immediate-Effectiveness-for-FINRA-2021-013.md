On page 8 of the rule change it says:

"*Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) significantly affect the*\
*protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on*\
*competition; and (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed,*\
*or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become effective pursuant*\
*to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act19 and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.*"

It seems like this rule doesn't affect us too much, and is more so just FINRA trying to gather more info on the hedgies in terms of their positions of treasury securities as well as "U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise\
securities". Basically FINRA wants to know what the fuck their positions are looking like in the reverse repo markets; they realize how bad its gotten and need to understand the extent of the potential damages that are being caused by the absolute BS that is going on.
