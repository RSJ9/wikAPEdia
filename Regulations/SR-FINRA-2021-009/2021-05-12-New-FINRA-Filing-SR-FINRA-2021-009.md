Loooool

So they want to put these liquidity tests on a schedule! Like tomorrow's liquidity test but consistently.

They want to make sure that there are no idiots with dumbass positions (page 4, copied below in a reply to this comment). If there are idiots, then it's margin call city baby.

This is a huuuuge middle finger to people with big short positions who experience market volatility. They need to calculate a LOT of things in their risk, especially open short positions and stupid derivative transactions.

This is not necessary for the MOASS. But prevents future ones. GME is that once in a lifetime opportunity!
