I'm smooth brained, but this filing seems intended to require large institutions to report any transactions they route through dark pools and alternative brokers to FINRA. Initially it was set to be approved today, enacted 30 days from now (Sept 8th) but an extension was just filed pushing the approval an extra week to Monday August 16th.

I've been seeing some tweet screenshots saying it was approved today. While it has the potential to really help curb some of the dark pool trades, it's been officially pushed back.

BTW I can take criticism so lay it on me if I have anything wrong here!

~~edit: What's with all the "following" comments? I must be out of the loop...~~

edit2: Thank you for the awards, whoever you are, but please spend it on yourself or at least a charity!

edit3: SR-FINRA-2021-009 was supposed to be approved today, and it wasn't. There are public documents that show the extension requesting for a later date, filed for a week out (Monday Aug 16th 2021).
