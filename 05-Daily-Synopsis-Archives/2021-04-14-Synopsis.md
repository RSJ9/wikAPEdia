Oh yeah this is all coming together

Ok so what's been happening? a few days ago GME updated their job listings to include specialism in blockchain crypte and everything, and Overstock had a likewise problem with shorts, google overstock short squeeze for further explanation.

Now what happened yesterday? oh nothing big just GME paying off all of it's debt 2 years in advance!

Because that's what a $10 dollar stock could/would do right? /sarcasm

Ok so why is this big or important? well most of the Bear thesis were built on this idea that a new bond offering and the already existing debt, If GameStop defaulted on these bonds they would have to file bankruptcy. but that's now a 100% off the table.

So now Short hedge funds are fucked, they physically can't get out of this situation as they can't use the shares from dark pools to close their positions (there aren't enough in there to do so). plus the millions of puts and calls... yeah kenny if you need a job after this my driveway needs sweeping.

Ok so lets go a little further why paying off a companies debt is important.

Because in some cases badly run stores where used as collateral, they couldn't be closed even if they where costing money, this means that now the debt is gone they can close the non profitable stores (giving them revenue from real estate and lower overhead/operational costs)

They can declare Dividends, make payments or redeem/repurchase capital stock or make distribution of said stock;

Ok this one is a biggie, as they can now offer dividends again, be it crypto or classic, or give a one time dividend or repurchase stock at open market (meaning they can create a smaller float) so this one seems to be a big thing

[A writeup on Crypto dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mq82ha/gamecoin_special_dividend_in_crypto_request/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Also of note, if GME offers crypto dividends don't worry they'll also explain at the time how this would be paid once the time is there.

Sell assets;

Again selling non profitable stores, creating a smaller operational costs overhead and cashing in on real estate.

now here is the biggest one I want to dive into, bigger then dividends? OH YEAH

Engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;

Ok ? but dividends where the big thing? Nah this is the biggest and most important part IMO, let's take a look at where our boy RC was yesterday with his tweet.

Culver City, CA

Ok let's see who is also near to that town, Super League gaming, with it's CEO Ann Hand. this could be a merger or joint venture with them to implement Esports in a big way in GME.

Who else is near there ? The dank Memelord himself Elon Musk, Elon has said that he wanted to add gaming into Tesla cars for a while now so who knows.

something GME added on their website starting yesterday (can't check myself Europoor) is Esports.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqcrc7/new_addition_to_gamestop_website_esports/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

Or perhaps he was there to check if they could work together in some way shape or form, or perhaps he would like either of them to be the new CEO we just don't know right now.

My personal opinion is most likely working together with either of them, Elon has expressed interest in gaming in Tesla's and well Esports will be a big part going forward so merging or working in conjunction with Super League gaming makes perfect sense to me.

But the most important thing to know is that GME is Debt free starting 4/30, meaning CNBC and others will most likely start saying shit like "GME halved their cash"... seriously any good news sends this stock down so... yeah I'm expecting that tbh.

Addendum:Â the debts will be payed at max around the 30th, other users have pointed out they can pay this debt off before that date, the 30th is just the last date they will pay it off.

it could be they need time for paperwork to be filed, funds to be relocated or other things.

Thank you Anklebrace <3

SEC filing

There has been a lot of questions around this and people pinging me, butÂ [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mq4gfi/sec_filing_merger_with_brokarage_detailing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)Â thread lays out pretty much everything about it and goes into it in far better detail then I could.

So strap in my friendly apes, we have no clue on what the effects of this will be, all we know is it will be a very bumpy ride.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.

And I'll be posting updates as they happen here:

Also I've suddenly seen an increase of new accounts spreading shit like "We ShOuLd HaShTaG OcCuPy WaLlStReEt" Fuck off. we are not a movement, we are not organized so stop making shit like this, because I'll just ban anyone trying this shit. those posts only go to show how we are uncivilized and wish harm on others, which we aren't and which we dont.

So if you see anyone post that crap, tag a mod
