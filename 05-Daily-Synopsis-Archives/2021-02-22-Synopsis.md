Goodmorning everyone,

I am Rensole, and I spilled coffee all over my crotch

*insert flashy intro card*

The Moon to Mars and beyond.

In the last week a lot has happened, so let me begin by stating, Thank you I appreciate the questions and I'm thankful to address this here and now.

In the last week we had a Hearing, we had our own LOTR; Return of the king, And Nasa landing on mars.

I'd like to personally thank Nasa on going ahead of the group in order to set up the welcoming committee.

The hearing Redux.

In the hearing we heard a lot, mostly how thankful Vlad can be, but also that Citadel and Melvin closed their positions on GME. In the days after the hearing it became evident due to the more astute retards on these boards that this was complete bullshit.I've been getting a lot DM's about this so let me address it here.See GME as apples, they bought apples, so normally in their books they should have apples written in right? But now they made fruit baskets, even though they just have the apples.But now instead of apples the books show fruit baskets.This is called creative bookkeeping or "cooking the books"

Even though they still are short GME it just shows up differently, but at the end of the day nothing has changed. well except public perception perhaps.

Robbing the Hood

So remember how Vlad said he was "forced" to close trading by the DTCC?Seems like Vladdy has been a naughty boy, he said that he was "Forced" to do so because he couldn't make the capital requirements.But a lot of people started questioning this from the get go, as we all thought there was more at hand, or at least more in the line of Collusion between the Hf's and Robinhood.

As the recent letter from the DTCC states

[![r/GME - Synopsis for 02-22-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/t2wp8wu4zzi61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=659c428d9bc2fd63ee7e5dc2f6b93ce3d891b239)](https://preview.redd.it/t2wp8wu4zzi61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=659c428d9bc2fd63ee7e5dc2f6b93ce3d891b239)

So this was fixed before market open, so why where we not allowed to trade ?

seems like vladdy has some explaining to do.

Catalysts

So the past week has been a long one. I mean holy shit a lot has happened right? We had a hearing of memes, DFV returning on screen, and for once we had the house committee on our side.

But most importantly when a representative asked if DFV would buy now at $45? our boy said a resounding yes.And guess what, the day after this motherfucking legend posted his update yolo once more.He has doubled his position. Take a moment and admire this mans amazing pair.

Also what's impressive to note is that [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) isn't the only one having a big pair this week. Apparently the Germans are coming through for us in the clutch, and not just any Germans.

But the German Bank Deutsche Bank invested in GME they bought 378823 stocks on 16/02/2021Edit: some users have pointed out that they bought these earlier, namely around Dec/ Jan, they need to report this within 45 days that's why it's showing up now.

Also Chamath Palipapitiya, who has been extremely outspoken about the short sellers and think what they are doing is illegal and should be put to jail, has posted yesterday.

This tweet like many others can be nothing, or he might have had enough of it and thought he'd finally get involved as he has often eluded to in recent interviews.

So it's fair to say, THE FIRE IS BACK BOYS!

We have seen such a huge change in mentality in the past week, it's beyond saying it's bullish, we are fired back up. I've seen so many people post great things this past week on how we are going to win again, the Fud has been lower and we are indeed going to get this sooner or later

What the fuck is an exit strategy?

So as the some may have seen we have had some weird posts in the past weeks, from full out "false flag" operations (shills) to "Oh wE NeEd tO cLo$e AboVE 40".The next one would most likely be "oh when we reach X amount we need to sell" or some shit like that.

Guys honestly relax, by the current estimates we are squeezing them so hard by the balls it's not just hurting them but any future grand children are going to feel this squeeze 40 years down the line.

1k is not a goal, it's a checkpoint, these guys need to buy the shares between 200 and 300% (as they have shorted it so much. and this is nothing more than supply and demand.

We OWN the Supply, they have the demand for the stock.

so WE set the price. and in doing so, 10k a stock is no longer a meme. As stated before in many threads they where greedy, and as long as we hold it can only skyrocket.

Good examples are exotic cars, while not all that special except for the brand name, a few brands own the complete market, thereby they are setting the price. If they would set it by quality of car or building costs we would have these cars at normal prices, but instead of that they OWN the market. Thus they set the price and we can't do shit about it.

Same go's for Melvin Citadel and the others.

They need our Banana Lambo's, we set the price.

KFC Double Down

Extra tendie edition.

Now there is also been some speech about "Double down Monday".

This originated most likely from the fact that DFV has doubled down. and I have to be honest get it, I do. But realize that during the hearing Melvin or Citadel (can't remember which one I thought Melvin) spoke about making monitoring tools for reddit so they could keep an eye on future meme stocks. if they're keeping an eye out for that you can be certain that he has at least one person checking the relative boards for noteworthy content.

Now what's the problem with that you ask?

Well if we all agree to buy on Monday just to get a price spike, that is blatant market manipulation. This is the same reason you've not heard anyone speak of "IF PRICE HITS X WE ALL SELL". Because both these things are illegal.

WE DO NOT DO AGREEMENTS ON WHEN TO BUY OR SELL!!!

I am personally getting more stocks today because I really like this stock and believe in the stock. if you'd like to get some stock today as well, please do so! Just don't post about agreements on times and dates, as making agreements related to stocks is still illegal. All I know is that I wont be selling bellow 10K.

Important Dates

Now before we move to this one please note this is both important to know and not to get your hopes up. they can and most likely will try to kick the can down the road.

As some of you may have noticed the XRT ETF is now the target of shorting instead of only just GME. This is bad right?

!!!NOPE!!!

I see this as an absolute win!. You know why? Because the GME stock doesn't give dividends, you know which one DOES give Dividends? You guessed it XRT!

Now in laymen terms, with GME they would've just need to cover the interest rate of the borrowed stock. But with XRT it's the interest AND the Dividends plus an interest on the dividends.So this will cost them more money than if they just stuck with GME.

XRT releases dividends every 3 months. Last one was December 20th ,2020.Estimated next payout is around mid March. By all conservative estimates they have to cover before this or they will take immeasurable losses. What is also noteworthy is that XRT has 18k volume on 80$ Puts for 3/19. The volume for 3/26 80$ puts is 142. GameStop has thousands and thousands of 800$ calls for? 3/19.

this in combination with the earnings report coming out between the 20/25th this could be a date to keep an eye on. Because someone is expecting that the economy will totally crash, SPY XRT and GME.

And again you may think this is just conjecture and you'd be right. But I'm dumb enough to know I don't know everything, and smart enough to listen to people who do.

Again none of this is financial advice, this is written by a moron who likes crayon soup.

again if I've missed anything please let me know and I'll add it in.

Edit: changed the Deutchebank information

Edit 2: it's important to not forget that the hearings are far from over, and the representatives need to know what's going on, and Melvin/Citadel is trying really hard to keep this out.So it's important to write to your representatives.a template and what else to do can be found here:<https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lp6phc/keep_the_pressure_on_your_representatives_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

Edit 3: As u/ [TelevisionNo1559](https://www.reddit.com/user/TelevisionNo1559) pointed out, apparently the next hearing will be march 11th
