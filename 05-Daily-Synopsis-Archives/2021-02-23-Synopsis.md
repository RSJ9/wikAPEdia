Good morning everyone,

AND I'M IN A GLASS BOX OF EMOTION!

Covering shorts

So this is something I've seen posted a lot since last week but received a lot of dm's regarding the shorts.

Now how do shorts work? well that's easy they borrow (NOT BUY) a stock from a buddy of theirs, sell it for a 100 and think it will go down, so they buy the stock back at 90 and return the stock, making 10 bucks in the process. but every day they borrow it they need to pay a % of interest on the borrowed stock, so the guy lending out the stock makes a little bit as well. Sounds simple and innocent right? but instead of taking the 10 bucks these guys thought, lets bankrupt the company, meaning they wouldn't need to return the stock and keep the 100 bucks.

That's the situation we find ourselves in right now. The difference is they borrowed the stock below the 30 bucks mark, meaning if they buy back now they are out of a lot of money.

Now how does that overlap from GME to XRT?

Good question and I appreciate the opportunity to address that here!

GME is an banana, XRT is a fruit basket.

The fruit basket has multiple items in it but also the GME bananas.

They know we based our information on the Short info we got from the stock, so they told the SEC "Nah bro we don't own the bananas, we owe them part of our fruit basket

"This is semantics, as the part of the fruit basket they own, IS STILL THE GME BANANAS.

But this keeps the GME BANANAS off the books, thinking that would change how we looked at the stock and hoping we would figure "shit the Squeeze has been Squoze" But we found out, and we are not the wolves of wallstreet, we are the Sharks of the web, and we smell the blood in the water.

some good explanation on why this is the Mother of all Squeezes can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lnxcio/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

GME AND CHILL

Instead of netflix and chill we now have our own guys creating a Deepfuckingvalue movie.\
We just have a trailer, and it looks AMAZING\
This was made by u/[thispersonedits](https://www.reddit.com/user/thispersonedits/) and it's one of the coolest things I've seen so far!

When moon?

I've been seeing (and been asked) this a lot, there is no date on our ticket guys.\
We know a few things for a fact. they need to cover at some point is a fact. Mark Cuban said "the lower the price the more power we as a group hold, as it becomes cheaper and cheaper to buy more and more". and guess what that fucker was right.

Yesterday we saw the same ladder attacks we have been seeing for weeks, someone even bought 100.000 shares to short from god knows where, dropped them all to crash the price\
And you know what happened? THAT MOTHER FUCKER BOUNCED RIGHT BACK!!

Now someone last week said we may be starting the squeeze at the end of February, not because of some specific date related thing but because volume is dying down.

originally posted by u/jeepers_sheepers

so what does this mean?\
Low volume means they don't have the amount of shares needed to fuck with our tendies as much as they did weeks ago.

you know why? because our retarded friends have been buying it all.so they have less and less shares to move around. and it's like selling some item, any item.

if you have 4% you can't set the price you have to follow the guys setting the price.\
But if you start buying so much along with your friends, and at some point you control more than 80% of the stuff available... you set the price, and the guys that used to run the show will have to listen to us.

EGO

Now with all that going on, why isn't Melvin and Citadel letting it skyrocket? I mean they could make money all the way to the top just like us right? ride this motherfucker into the moon?

See this is where the problem is, it's not about money for them anymore, it's about EGO, they wont be able to live with themselves if they got beat by "dumb money".

All in all that's literally it, nothing more, nothing less.

just figure the guy who got more than 1.8 billion in 2020, Yes Kenny 2020 was really hard for all of us...and imagine him being at a next social party, and he is normally a big shot, suddenly he is a nobody because we have pegged him so hard with our dumb money, no one is ever going to take him seriously anymore.

Our AMC brethren

What? AMC ON OUR GME? yes hold up and relax.\
As some of you know (or at least I hope most of you) AMC is in the same boat as us, shorted to hell and back, by the same companies mind you!

But something sweet happened, New York is opening the theaters at 25% and guess what, AMC popped yesterday.

This means that the hedgies started to bleed from more than only GME but also AMC.

I'd like to thank everybody for now we can finally show a literal definition of "death by a thousand papercuts" in action

Planer of the apes: IV A new hope.

God damn yesterday was wild!

pre market all the way up to 18%, close of day at 13.33% ALL THAT was because of us.

Buy, hold repeat.

This fucked with their ladder shit so much that even though they where trying they got fucked over by us, the little guy, this wasn't because of a whale, this wasn't because of congress or media or whatever.

just US

So be sure to give yourself enough credit with this, dip buy hold repeat. and you know what, I'm gonna say it, this may be the beginning of the new squeeze. Don't be delusional to think it will happen in 2 days, but I think before the end of the week we can be at the 70 point again.

why? because these idiots didn't fight with other hedgies, they chose to fight with retards.\
Retards who know a rabbit hole as we have found ourselves in one often enough, and there is only one way out of this and that's for the other party to buy the shares back.

What if Melvin or Citadel go's bankrupt?

Doesn't matter, watch the big short.

Someone will ALWAYS be stuck with the bill, be it the brokers, the clearing houses or the government. Someone will pay and we will get our tendies.

Just so everyone knows FINRA short interest reports will be coming out TOMORROW! This will be a good point for us to tell how much they have shorted on GME and XRT. (or maybe other ETFS that have GME).

So now what?

First of all I'd like to say that's a great question and I'm happy to address them here and now, when I was a young boy in Bulgaria we where looking at the charts and we could always see that at 10AM the idiots start to short ladder and the price drops. This is like going to get some water at the cooler and that annoying idiot from accounting is there. We know it's going to happen, we know he's going to be there, just try to be nice and keep on going.

same go's with the shares, but before going on let me state WE DO NOT MAKE PRICE AGREEMENTS. But here is what I think, 100 bucks is ground floor with the new board, in the past weeks they have already expanded their business from just consoles to also include PC and things that revolve around pc's (mouse keyboards graphics cards you name it). this adds an entire new group.

we will get the q4 earning report next month.

So lets compare this to an actual video game, The Witcher 3.

WTF why? because there is a story that we know, and cd project red is known for giving free updates, and free dlc.

by my estimates 1K is a checkpoint, 10k is the boss

BUT WAIT! I'm fairly sure this game is going to get some extra story DLC and we will be getting more bang for our buck, meaning 10k is not the ending, we will be getting more. How much more we don't know, but all I know is that this can be a big.

This has been Channel 4 news.

Remember this is not financial advice I'm actually retarded.

Stay classy GME

As always feel free to let me know if I've missed anything and I'll add it in here.
