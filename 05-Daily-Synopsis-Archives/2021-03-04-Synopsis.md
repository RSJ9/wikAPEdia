Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Seriously do you smell that? smells like someone shit themselves.

*insert flashy intro card*

The hunt for red Shills

Ok guys lets start with something simple. as of this week I've noticed a change in this sub, we have seen some more shills come out of the woodwork, and everyone is fighting them.

Let me be clear, Report them via modmail, flag their comment and post¬†And the mods will handle it!

The problem is if we get a mob mentality things can get bad real quick, I've personally seen a user getting death threats, told him to kill himself and he posted that he wished cancer on anyone. The user in question just had a really bad day, something all of us can have from time to time, and spent a good time talking with him just to make sure he wouldn't do anything to himself.

This is like being a soldier in Afghanistan at night, every bush and tree looks like an enemy combatant at night.

That's why we say don't take justice into your own hand, report them, there may be an actual person on the other side. so let the mods handle it.

Don't hurt the good people in this community, we are a community which helps each other through the good days and the bad ones, we are not in this for tendies for ourselves, we are in it to have enough tendies to help others around us. So lets be at least kind to each and everyone while we are here.

So fucking mature it hurts.

Now lets talk about bonds (no relax we are not going to go on a team bonding exercise).

no actual¬†Bonds,¬†A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments.

So this is (how I can understand it) a sort of IOU that a company gives out so that it can make some quick capitol, so they don't have to sell things off but still get a influx of new money.

Think of it like WW2, remember those war bonds? the government sold these bonds so they could have enough money to go to war.

Now GME did the same, and guess what. they are maturing on the 15th of this month.

Generally, the longer the term to maturity is, the higher the interest rate on the bond will be and the less volatile its price will be on the secondary bond market. Also, the further a bond is from its maturity date, the larger the difference between its purchase price and its redemption value, which is also referred to as its principal, par, or face value.

Meaning that most of these bonds are either one year old (most likely imo) or longer.

I have no idea how this will affect the stock (as always a smart ape will answer bellow and I'll look into it more and update the thread here). but regardless this is information we should know.

I think these may have functioned much like shorts, meaning they could sell it off in the secondary bond market, but if the company went bankrupt they didn't have to pay anything? again I'm not extremely familiar with this side but I'm sure this has to be important in some way.

R oc K e T stocks

seriously stfu about them, by continuing to talk about them you are helping the other team. new people come in and see it and may get confused. so lets keep this board GME like its meant to.

SHENANIGANS!

Yesterday we have seen something weird in the aftermarket.

namely a lot of big name stocks suddenly dipping, this could give us an idea of a bigger company selling a big chunk of their stock to get some money.

If this happened on one stock I'd chalk it up to coincidence, seeing it is on a lot of them, I think someone is either getting ready to make some bigger moves on the field to buy in on something, or maybe it's someone getting enough capital in order to pay for the 30k ITM on Friday.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxa7j6/massive_stock_dips_after_hours_signal_gme_may_go/>

Again the fact that it has happened on so many, who knows wtf is going on, I personally think it may be someone getting cash for ITM calls, or someone who want's to make some moves and it can be gme but there is a chance it has nothing to do with gme.

Statistical correlation.

So some people have been posting something very nice, MATHS.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx4gbv/yall_this_is_statistically_significant_action/>

This smart ape used a statistical analysis to see the correlation between the pre January squeeze to the current situation.

As we have seen time and time again, when the market go's red GME go's green.And well... the entirety of Nasdaq is down 2.5% and GME is up 5%.<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx9086/dont_fucking_tell_me_that_gme_is_not_a_great_if/>

Again, relax if you see red this is normal, we are still up over 200% from last week, which is great in my book.

Hey, if you bought something through¬†[Gamestop.com](https://gamestop.com/)¬†recently like many have. Go give them your honest review on trustpilot!

<https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.gamestop.com>

The old reviews and the people shitting on the company for not having their PS5s or new Xbox there doesn't really reflect how the store is today. and the lack of consoles are not the retailers fault either.

Looking for a job? Gme got you fam.

as some may have seen in the news we are "jobless nihilistic trolls" etc etc.

But GME got you covered, they posted yesterday that they are looking for 3424 positions to be filled.

<https://careers.gamestop.com/search>

Again seems they are trying to expand in the right way.

(also seems like a very low rating for the GME HQ doesn't it? it's a shame I love that place)

wtf is an exit strategy?

Ok so I've seen a lot of posts regarding the 1k/10k/100k hypothesis.

But I think maybe this post explains it best (just found the screenshot if someone could find a link to the original thread I'll link it here).

Low volume? can't I'm fucking deaf.

Great theory posted here¬†<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx9ut2/finra_data_now_shows_only_28_million_gme_short/>

The last time we have seen such low volume is when we saw the price jump from $40 to $120 right now.

I really miss these billboards üåù

GME GO BRRR

I have to give it to everyone here, both members and the lurkers, yeah I see you!

We hold the line so good at it that we make Leonidas and his 300 naked dudes look like pussies, but our test is't here in the low ball numbers, our test will be when we go high.

Our test will come when you see the price go to $1000, do you want life changing money for a few months? or the rest of your life?Plan your exit strategy, plan it on logic so that you wont be overcome with excitement when it happens.

RULE YOUR EMOTIONS, DO NOT LET THEM RUN YOU!

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxdt5t/mental_preparations_for_launch_off/>

hypothetically this can go into the thousands, be it 4 digits, 5 or 6 or even higher, no one knows.

All I know is that I will trying to get a lot of leather bound books after this

Just remember, plan for every possible situation and you'll never be caught off guard.Plan for this crashing back to $40, make a plan for if it stays between $100 and $200, make one for $1k, one for $10k and fuck it make a plan for if this go's into the millions.

You wont need half of them in the end but it did make sure that you did plan for the scenario's that WILL happen.

A general makes 15 plans for 1 mission, if option 1 doesn't work, go to option 2, if something changes which aligns with plan 14 go with that.

PLAN FOR EVERYTHING.

EXPECT FUCKERY

EXPECT THEM CHEATING

EXPECT THEM TO TRY AND SPREAD FUD

EXPECT EVERYTHING.

As always none of this is financial advice, I'm like the Ryan Dunn of this group, I shove crayons and hotweels up my ass.... don't kink shame me Sharon.

Edit 1:

Melvin planted stories about their FEB performance.

written by¬†[u/burner20170218](https://www.reddit.com/u/burner20170218/)

```
Hello apes, I'm a former reporter at Bloomberg.
I cannot divulge my name, but ask me anything else and I will try to prove I'm not bullshitting.

Anyway, today we saw Bloomberg, CNBC, and Reuters simultaneously blast glowing articles about how Plotkin made 20% in Feb.
Every story came out at the same time and cited "sources" or
"people familiar with the matter,"
but barely had any other details.
This is typical of story planted by PR.

PRs will tell every reporter on the street
"hey I got a tip for you but don't publish until Wednesday after market."
And every reporter thinks they have an exclusive and types up the article.
And then PR gets the most bang for the buck as every outlet publishes the same bullshit at the same time.

I would know. I deal with Melvin's cunty COO David Kurd when I was reporting on them. This is his usual tactic.

Anyway, I don't know if they're lying about these gains.
Probably not.
Maybe they fudged some mark-to-market valuations to show a good month.
But the bigger takeaways is that Melvin is desperate to improve their image.
They are weak.
We are strong.
Fuck Plotkin and fuck Kurd.
Let's keep digging into their positions.
