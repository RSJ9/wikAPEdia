Fellow Apes, you may remember me from my post on Friday analyzing¬†[why hedge funds couldn't have repositioned on the 28th, and why they couldn't have covered on the 29th](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/?ref=share&ref_source=link). My post gained a lot of interest and I am glad you all appreciated my analysis.ü¶ç

Last night something interesting was brought to my attention, and I think you guys might want to take a look. After the post gained popularity on the 6th, Fintel significantly altered the short volume of GME.

As you can see, GME short volume was REDUCED BY HALF on the 7th

I was curious if this was simply a normal thing for them to do, to alter short volume randomly on weekends, so I checked the short volume for Tesla to see if it was also reduced.¬†It was not.

As you can see, all of the GME short volume was reduced by half on the 7th, but none of the TSLA short volume was reduced. Why would that be?

Well, the same thing was done for AMC.

AMC reduced by 50%

But not for Apple

Honestly, all I can say is¬†very sloppy Fintel, very sloppy.

I'm not sure what your explanation for this is, but it looks like you're manipulating the short volume of specific stocks.

I presume the analysis from my original post was pretty spot on to warrant the alteration of short volume for particular stocks.

Why would hedge funds be going nuclear with media FUD, disinformation campaigns and bots? Why would seemingly reliable sources of financial statistics be altering specific stats for tickers that gain public attention?

Here are some additional sources of people talking about this,¬†[1](https://youtu.be/uJuHEsemSqo),[2](https://twitter.com/TradesTrey/status/1358620225500020740?s=19)

TLDR: Just read it guys, this one was quick. Fintel appears to be caught red handed altering the short volume of stocks like GME and AMC, but not for stocks like TSLA and AAPL. I have provided the receipts and it is clear what they have done. Think critically about every source of information you come across, because they hedge funds may be covering their tracks. Start keeping your receipts.

I found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion. Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock's activity. This is only a healthy criticism and review of one potential source of financial information. I own shares of GME, TSLA and AAPL.
