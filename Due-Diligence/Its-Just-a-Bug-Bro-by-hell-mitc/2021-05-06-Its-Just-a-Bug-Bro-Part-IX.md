TLDR: Theyre confusing us again and it makes me more comfy because I found proof some large shorts haven't covered (and are actually trying to hide it).

Alright guys. Something is starting to happen. Do you smell that? Smells like money. Could just be fear emanating from the HedgeFucks because we have figured out a lot of their guises.

Weird shit is being spread all over tied to things we are all noticing. And that is the goal. They are trying to spread confusion among us. WSB mods all of a sudden showing up halfway though a comment to say how great they are, and how a reddit bug causes them to reshuffle mods by adding a bunch of new ones. Then throwing out a literal map of their burner accounts because people questioned it. Oh and my favorite, one guy saying they reshuffle for fun, and a top mod saying they have to, to a point they literally have to make a post about it. Let alone the guys calling us "retailers".

We are getting closer, and they know it. They have started to try to get fellow redditors to join in. And this is how comfy we should be. No stress. No confusion. Just patient and waiting. Because I have some nice little news for us.

This comfy.

So, I started a week ago combing through 13F-HR filings on the EDGAR site. And it came to me that the first quarter ended just over a month ago (no shit, right? That was kind of why I was doing it and didn't realize). The important part here is the fact that these documents¬†HAVE¬†to be submitted 45 days after the quarter ends. Guess when that is? That is correct. Next Friday if we are talking straight days. And I have seen no mention of business days so fuck off with that or show me the 1933 law that says business days. That is why we have seen so many Feb filings at the end year. They all rush them in after consolidating their books.

With the SEC on a war-path after the news they were fining companies for late submissions, I think this is going to be our first glimpse at whether the shorts covered (hint: they didn't and I have already found a few).

We will be here, patiently waiting and researching more. So, on to the shorts that I found. They are getting smarter. They have found better ways to hide them, but they cant make them disappear. And some might be cash covered (I doubt it, but don't have that info), but it would be more strange to not just hedge if you knew a bunch of apes were about to chase you down and ass-fuck you because that's what you did to their parents all these years.

Ok moving on. Here they are. I started by searching "Gamestop" for the first 20 or so, and realized that one company had hidden them by not putting the name of¬†*any*¬†organization. So I had to go by CUSIP.¬†36467W109.

Searching with the CUSIP made it pop up immediately. I debated waiting for a bit to post this, because I wanted to see if they changed tactics, but nothing in the last couple days suggests that this is being done by a large firm, it could just be to see if we would catch it. Well, I did, so they will have to try again.

Here's our first look at "tHE ShoRtTS CovERDDdd". Did they though? Because we would have noticed 69k buy. Hell, even a 13K+ buy would stand out the way we are all watching level 2.

Notice how "Creative Planning" decided to hide the name "Gamestop" by putting theirs? Yep. But they can't hide the CUSIP. Damn thats a lot of puts.

Why do I think this isn't covered?

Well, for one, "Creative Planning" has no shares. Two, Cowen and Co. only hold 111... And this list has been put together from ~500 13F-HR filings.

I am trying to build a scrape to get more info as we go, but the HTML data is listed differently for each company. So there doesn't seem to be any consistency. It may need to be a macro but I am not sure. I would assume the SEC has someone reviewing these daily who get paid to do it, not me who is ducking client calls and procrastinating so I can comb through 13F filings. Haha they do, right? RIGHT!?

There is a call page as well. It is rather disappointing.

Sad as fuck.

So, what can we get from this data?

Basically, not very many funds are holding GME. That isn't a bad thing. We know that this is retails game. And this somewhat proves it. If we are all in the same mindset of hedgies r fuk, then this might actually come to fruition. We just can't paper hand like a bitch halfway up the ladder.

Another thing I noticed. A lot (and I mean¬†A LOT) of these funds are holding iShares, Vangaurd, and/or Berkshire Hathaway. I made a comment the other day. Why would a fund manager be in straight ETFs (with the exception of bonds and emerging markets) unless you knew something might be going on with those funds? I mean, you could really just yolo all your clients money into ETFs and set it on autopilot, but psychologically that doesn't make sense if youre a fund manager. You would want continuous returns, because you want to apply for the fund position opening at BlackRock.

Anyway, here is a look at the few Puts I was able to find. All seem to be naked, or cash covered, but they wouldn't be trying so hard to hide them I would think if that was the case (or they weren't going to have to move assets like Bill Gates to cover his divorce).

Logically, until we see these filings come out for the next set of funds, we can only wait. And the rest is speculation.

Oh, and Melvin? I know we said that these were amendments, but why is your head legal counsel filing an amendment when 1st quarter results are supposed to be coming out?

And those saying Citadel Sec isn't the same as the Advisors? You're correct, but they still have to file and it would be included in the 13F filing, look at the documents:

THEY HAVE TO INCLUDE CIT SECURITIES IN THEIR FILINGS.¬†That is why they have these forms. We are about to see some more weird, underhanded strange data, because they are starting to get sloppy and just try to cover their asses (they can't, they should just cover their shorts and it will).

Anyway, cheers everyone. Hope this helps.
