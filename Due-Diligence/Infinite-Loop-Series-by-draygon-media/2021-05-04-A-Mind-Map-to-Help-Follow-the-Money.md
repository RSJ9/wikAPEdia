This is not FA... I do not advise doing anything based on this information... I am just a person who likes to look at the big picture. What better way to look at the big picture than with a mind map?!

This is an ever evolving mind map, and made by 1 person at the moment. I have done my best to cross check information, so PLEASE take it with a grain of salt. But know that there is something very interesting within the mess.

TLDR: Just read it please... I am providing a graphic and all to follow along with. Without the following information, the mind map WON'T make much sense.

So... Let's dive in.

My goal here is to demonstrate how big this ALL goes. While we short sightedly focus on AMC and GME, because it is the big thing at the moment; we must look at who is in on this. But, let's go back in time for just a moment.

The year? 2008... This was a big moment of bailouts, and guess who got one of the BIGGEST bailouts.

AIG

(<https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/american-investment-group-aig-bailout.asp#:~:text=The%20amount%20the%20U.S.%20government,79.9%25%20of%20the%20company's%20equity.&text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20and%20the,to%20an%20estimated%20%24150%20billion>.)

"At its peak, AIG had a market capitalization four times the size of Lehman at the latter's highest. However, AIG was bailed out not purely because of its size, according to Antoncic. "It's not just the size that matters; it is the interconnectedness," she said. If AIG failed, it would trigger a domino effect globally as the insurance giant had provided protections worth more than half a trillion dollars, including $300 billion to banks in the U.S. and in Europe. "Imagine if AIG went away. All of these banks would have had enormous regulatory capital problems. It would have been an extremely systemic macro event." (<https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-good-reasons-why-lehman-failed/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLehman%20basically%20put%20the%20nail,its%20size%2C%20according%20to%20Antoncic>.)

AIG was chosen to be saved, which would in turn cause Lehman Brothers to go under. This led me down the track of who was invested into AIG currently.

Through the mind map, I have condensed this information. But you are MORE than welcome to sift through it as well!

You will find some of the big names that we are currently in a situation in as we speak!

Here is the color code surrounding AIG:

Purple- I have not dug into at the moment

Pink- Institution that keeps popping up, and I am keeping an eye on.

Dark Red- Currently have information, but have not been able to add it

Black- Main leads that I wanted to look into

(Vanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, SunAmerica, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, BMO, T. Rowe Price)

What I began to find while diving into the 13D holdings was very interesting. (This is different than the 13f filings) *information taken from fintel ownership section, trying to confirm against Bloomberg as soon as possible!)

As you can see, Vanguard has 13D filings in:

BlackRock

AIG

Morgan Stanley

Goldman Sachs

JPMorgan

Ameriprise (check out where it leads to)

Janus Henderson (Another one that leads to the same place)

BlackRock:

Morgan Stanley

Goldman Sachs

JPMorgan

AIG

The other grey boxes surrounding the banks indicates corporations who HAVE 13D filings for the institution.

Morgan Stanley was in interesting one to me, since this is the one I ended up focusing a lot on given their standing with AMC. This is where I found quite the loop in investing.

Morgan Stanley is in AMC > BlackRock is invested into Morgan Stanley > Vanguard has a good size holding in BlackRock> BlackRock is ALSO invested into Vanguard's ETF's> Vanguard and BlackRock also have holdings in AMC and GME>AMC and GME are HELD in ETF's that are owned by Vanguard and BlackRock (along with many others).

This is just ONE loop that I came across that I found fascinating.

Are you still with me? Try to follow the lines of connection on the mind map.

The orange boxes around GME are the 13D filings, and the green boxes around AMC are their 13D filings. (Again, not 13F's)... There are some in here that I am STILL trying to verify because I am getting conflicting information from various sources. Most of these have been checked through Bloomberg, and this will ALL be updated as I find more! Check out the various investors... see any INTERESTING institutions?

You can see that by just looking at the investors, that there are 3 connecting points:

Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, BlackRock, and Vanguard.

"But there has to be more connecting points, right?"

I am happy you asked... Why YES! Yes there is!

This takes me back to February, when I (and all apes who noticed) the charta for AMC and GME were moving in the same manner. I started diving into the research as to what would cause this. My fun friends that I have been tracking since... THE ETF'S!

The ETF bubbles you see have been increased and decreased since this inception due to the increase or decrease of ETF's AMC and GME are held in. There are many of these ETF's that hold other favorites to watch as well (Apple, Tesla, Microsoft... you get the picture). On days that GME and AMC start to move the same way, I tend to watch if Apple, Tesla, and/or other meme/tech stocks who seem to move similarly.

Usually, they do.

Why is that you may ask...

Well you see, there are 21... yes 21 ETF's that hold both AMC and GME... and the one I tend to keep a close eye on is the Russel 2000 ETF's with Vanguard.

In my digging around, I confirmed that this was the one to watch, because our dear friend Morgan Stanley. (I told you they were one to watch)

In February, Morgan Stanley reported a 671.27% increase in ownership. (<https://fintel.io/so/us/vrtix/morgan-stanley>)

I will continue to monitor this one for sure!

I still have a TON of work to do with different connections, and I will release part 2 once that is finished. Part 2 will contain more ETF holdings by institutions, information on the three institutions at the top (and where they are tying into this) as well as any other pertinent information I think is needed.

Part 3... I am looking into the housing market with all of this... but that may be a bit depending on time!

I hope you enjoyed my findings, and feel free to dive deeper into it! If you have information you want me to add or look into let me know!
