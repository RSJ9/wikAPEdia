What up APES,

Today we are going to have a 2-day update on DEEP ITM calls because I was too busy to make a post yesterday. Thank you to all who were concerned I was gone but...

3/11: 3:38pm 2150 calls purchased from PHLX for $54 million ($12, $15 and $18 calls) (each contract cost roughly 25k for my smooth brained friends) underlying share price - $261.36

If you didn't see my last post on my theory for what caused the mega dip go check it out

Something to note: These deep ITM calls are much different than someone buying $800 strike OTM yolo plays. Rather than spending the bulk of the money on theta (time value x volatility premium) the buyer chose to purchase a much more physical asset (the Intrinsic value of the deep ITM calls). This isn't someone saying I think this stock will reach some astronomical price, this is an individuals decision to make a 100MM investment basically into the stock of this company.

We are in good hands now APES
