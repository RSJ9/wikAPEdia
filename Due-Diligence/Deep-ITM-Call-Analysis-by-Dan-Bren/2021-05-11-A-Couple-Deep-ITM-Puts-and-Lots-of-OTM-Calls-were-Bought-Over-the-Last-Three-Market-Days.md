Good evening Apes,

Sorry for the lack of posts lately but sometimes life gets in the way. Fortunately I still managed to find time to save the data from each market day. With that said let's get into it.

GME Biggest Options Trades 5/7/21

Friday is where we basically saw all of the action. There were block purchases of 684 $300 puts for $9,435,780 with expirations 5/7(same day) and 6/18 out of EMLD (Miami). The other super interesting action can be found within the $800 calls purchased in mass quantities (~5063 calls) expiring July 16. These trades total somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 million and came out of BZX (Chicago) and GEMX (regional exchange for Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia). Quick crayon break and we'll move on.

Nothing really of note on Monday a relatively quiet day on the options front.

GME Biggest Options Trades 5/11/21

Today (tuesday) was another seemingly calm day in terms of options although we saw a bit more activity with the $800 OTM calls with roughly 346 purchased in large block trades out of BZX and PEARL with the same July 16 expiration date. Let's keep in mind these $800 DEEP OTM calls are very cheap but they still have a cost. Not sure if these are being used as a bullish bet, as a hedge, or if somehow this all ties back to the FTD resets. Not my job to sit here and speculate, I am just a smooth-brained crayon eating ape that's here to bring you the data. Hopefully will be seeing you again tomorrow.¬†[u/Dan_Bren](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dan_Bren/)¬†out.
