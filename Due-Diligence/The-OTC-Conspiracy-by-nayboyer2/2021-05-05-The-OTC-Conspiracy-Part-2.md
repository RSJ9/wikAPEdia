I'll try to make this post short and sweet!

Please refer to my previous post ([The OTC Conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/myf505/probably_the_last_dd_youll_ever_need_to_read_the/)), which I updated with some charts and will continue to update with weekly data as it becomes available from the¬†[FINRA OTC website](https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcIssueData).

For this DD, I took a look at the monthly OTC data for GME vs 33 other "popular" stocks. I chose the stocks more or less at random based on Boomer-ism, personal interest, or stock price. I'd be happy to include some additional ticker requests in the next update.

Let's start with the monthly OTC trading data for GME.

Table 1: GME Monthly OTC Data

A major increase in number of OTC trades and a major decrease in average shares/trade

For all those visual apes:

Increasing number of OTC trades

GME OTC trades are getting smaller and smaller

That's interesting. So an increasing number of smaller trades (aka¬†high frequency trading). I wonder how these metrics compare to other stocks...

Let's start from the beginning.

December 2020

[![r/Superstonk - The OTC Conspiracy (Part 2) - Shining Some Light into the Dark Pool data (March Update)](https://preview.redd.it/bbhpm3g6acx61.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1245f7fcb0247a1788844ce5271edcd4f2ab439)](https://preview.redd.it/bbhpm3g6acx61.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1245f7fcb0247a1788844ce5271edcd4f2ab439)

GME with less than 500,000 OTC trades in December 2020

[![r/Superstonk - The OTC Conspiracy (Part 2) - Shining Some Light into the Dark Pool data (March Update)](https://preview.redd.it/jcxj1y4bdcx61.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=8efc3fcdb1516ed73d5a2a54e98110ce260ec121)](https://preview.redd.it/jcxj1y4bdcx61.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=8efc3fcdb1516ed73d5a2a54e98110ce260ec121)

The number of shares/trade looks fairly typical compared to the rest

What about % of Float traded OTC in December?

[![r/Superstonk - The OTC Conspiracy (Part 2) - Shining Some Light into the Dark Pool data (March Update)](https://preview.redd.it/o14u19bodcx61.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e655efcb99f04c3a0fa009569a129ce5e05784)](https://preview.redd.it/o14u19bodcx61.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e655efcb99f04c3a0fa009569a129ce5e05784)

Little bit of an outlier, with almost 2000% of the GME float traded OTC in January

February 2021

[![r/Superstonk - The OTC Conspiracy (Part 2) - Shining Some Light into the Dark Pool data (March Update)](https://preview.redd.it/1hjg1qdjjcx61.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=04f55c207cb04d50f10dbedc8c2c4a9cdc9afb6f)](https://preview.redd.it/1hjg1qdjjcx61.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=04f55c207cb04d50f10dbedc8c2c4a9cdc9afb6f)

[![r/Superstonk - The OTC Conspiracy (Part 2) - Shining Some Light into the Dark Pool data (March Update)](https://preview.redd.it/qy7rbq5d3ex61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ca8be113ca4b1431444886e81c9a2edd1c75b1)](https://preview.redd.it/qy7rbq5d3ex61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ca8be113ca4b1431444886e81c9a2edd1c75b1)

Putting it all together

Conclusions

Please take a look at my previous post ([The OTC Conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/myf505/probably_the_last_dd_youll_ever_need_to_read_the/)) for a more in-depth dive into the weekly OTC data. It also includes a breakdown of the major players in the OTC marketplace. I will continue to update that post as data is released.

The purpose of this post was to compare the OTC trading of GME vs some other "popular" stocks.

-   The number of monthly GME OTC trades increased¬†over 28x¬†from September 2020 to March 2021.

-   The average shares/trade has decreased every month, from over 400 shares/trade in September to 32 shares/trade in March.

-   Only¬†GME,¬†Tesla, and¬†Sony¬†averaged less than 40 shares/trade in a month. GME has done it twice - each of the last two months.

-   The 32.87 shares/trade average in March was the lowest for any stock across any month.

-   The % of GME float traded OTC has been over¬†260%¬†every month since September 2020 and increased to almost¬†2000%¬†in January 2021.

-   In February, another¬†1131%¬†of the GME float was traded in OTC, followed by¬†944%¬†in March.

-   The % of float traded OTC is much higher for GME than any of the other stocks that were evaluated. The only exception was¬†SLGG¬†(1724%¬†in March). Shout out to the sluggs!

-   Besides GME (and SLGG in March), only AMC had more than¬†100%¬†of float traded OTC in any month.

-   If we look at¬†Q1 data, over¬†4043%¬†of the GME float was traded OTC in¬†Q1¬†alone.

-   In Q1, only AMC (24.2 million) had more OTC trades than GME (21.2 million).

-   SLGG (1883%) and AMC (1195%) are the only other stocks with over¬†220%¬†of their floats traded OTC.

-   Including SLGG and AMC, only 6 of the 33 stocks traded over¬†100%¬†of their floats OTC during Q1.

-   22 of the 33 had less than¬†40%¬†of their floats traded OTC during Q1.

-   19 of the 33¬†had less than¬†20%¬†of their floats traded OTC during Q1.

Bananas for Thought

How did those sneaky Market Makers trade¬†over 4000%¬†of the GME float on just the OTC marketplace during Q1?

What about those diehard, diamond-handed apes who have been holding bananas since 2020?

Why have we seen a progressive decrease in GME volume every month?

-   1.26 billion in January

-   827.56 million in February

-   679.79 million in March

-   172.43 million in April

-   Record lows in May...

Is the banana factory broken? Are all of the bananas finally drying up?

Where did they come up with the¬†172.43 million¬†additional shares that were traded in April?

What about those April options contracts? Tick tock...

How many bananas did they "produce" in their factory?

And how many bananas are they now going to have to buy back???!!!

OoOoOoOoOo I think they naked...

TLDR: Buy, HODL, Vote --> tendies!!! (not financial advice)
