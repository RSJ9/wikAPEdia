The OTC Conspiracy plot thickens...

January 2021 OTC trades just increased by over 32% overnight.

I was compiling data for a separate DD, but found this new "glitch" on the¬†[FINRA OTC website](https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcIssueData)¬†data and feel like we need more eyes and ears on it before the data "expires" on the OTC website.

Keep your screenshots apes!

Robinhood is still cooking the January books to try to make their numbers work

After previously having¬†ZERO¬†OTC transactions in January 2021, on¬†8/10 and 8/11¬†(last Tuesday and Wednesday), Robinhood added¬†1,869,026 shares¬†and¬†1,850,153 trades¬†to the January running total.

One million, eight hundred fifty thousand, one hundred fifty-three previously unreported OTC trades from January 2021...

That increased January's GME OTC numbers to:

527,116,572¬†shares traded

7,627,798¬†trades

and brought the January average shares/trade down from 90.91 to¬†69.10¬†(nice).

Robinhood Securities¬†is now responsible for over¬†24%¬†of the January 2021 GME OTC trades, after accounting for¬†0%¬†up until last week.

The number of January GME OTC trades increased by¬†32%.

I guess DFV isn't the only one with a time machine.

Is this how they're rationalizing all the fractional RH shares from January that were used in transfers to Fidelity?

They just kept a rolling tally of IOUs tucked away in a suitcase and plugged them into past OTC data from back in January, hoping we wouldn't notice?

20 OTC participants¬†during the week of 1/25 to try to keep the rocket from launching?

Almost¬†186 million shares¬†traded OTC in one week (when the actual GME float was less than 30 million)?

Almost¬†6 million trades¬†OTC?

RH sliding in almost 7 months later to cook the books and increase the weekly number of GME OTC trades by¬†38.95%¬†to try to make the numbers work?

Hey SEC, GG, FINRA, FBI - wut doing???
