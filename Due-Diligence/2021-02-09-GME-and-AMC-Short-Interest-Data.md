Finra, Fintel, and Wall Street Journal are reporting different percentages.

[Finra - GME](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH)Â --Â Short Interest: 78.46\
[Finra - AMC](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G)Â --Â Short Interest: 15.70 (some people have reported that it's not updating for them and they still see 38.12)

[Fintel - GME](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)Â -- Short interest % of Float:Â 44.02\
[Fintel - AMC](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc)Â -- Short interest % of Float:Â 68.48

[WSJ - GME](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME)Â --Â Short interestÂ % of Float:Â 41.95\
[WSJ - AMC](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC)Â --Â Short interestÂ % of Float:Â 66.06

Edit 1:Â As a post mentioned earlier today, Citadel has lied before about their short interest data. There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.

Edit 2:Â Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.

Edit 3:Â I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don't think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest â‰  Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float

Edit 4:Â Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.

Edit 5:Â I've got about 750 shares of GME and a little over 8,000 AMC. I'm holding both. The discrepancies in the data across all these sites is all you need to know. To the moon ðŸš€ðŸŒ’
