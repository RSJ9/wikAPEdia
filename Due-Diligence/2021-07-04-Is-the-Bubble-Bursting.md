[DD üë®‚Äçüî¨](https://web.archive.org/web/20210705034232/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

I am an XXX holder and a QA rep. Numbers are my thing at work and analyzing the numbers on the market do not make sense right now. Please don't kick my ass over this not being charts of GME. I am thoroughly convinced that almost anything market related could lead to a GME squeeze.

By now, I'm sure everyone has read the house of cards, as well as, the everything short. GameStop is connected to everything as of this point. If we are talking about a 200,300,400 etc. % short interest, then everything leads back to GameStop. (or whatever entities are shorting GameStop) Downvote me if you'd like, but I believe the housing market could be our card to start our show if a dividend is not what first kicks us off.

*The Curtains are starting to be pulled open*

Why does this matter? Housing market doesn't affect GME?

FuCk YoU iT DoES. No but really, when these banks start losing money on defaults and risky mortgages, you really think they want to further their losses by dealing with some over leveraged funds? No. The house of cards is real, and it isn't if the house is coming down, its WHAT card will bring it down. Lets begin.

TLDR: Everyone is kicking the can down the road, even the government. I firmly believe we will see an economic collapse or correction of at least 35%. With GMEs negative beta and amount of short positions and naked shorting, should the housing market fall, it will create a ripple effect and the curtains for our show will be opened and it will begin. Inflation, unemployment, housing prices, CPI all rising but wages staying the same. The bubble is running out of room to expand.

Lumber prices currently cut in half from peak.

People who say lumber prices are fueling the housing inflation crisis are wrong, but, people will still look at this as a negative sentiment and may begin looking for an out. (selling their property)

Mortgage applications rate YOY Refinancing

Mortgage applications rate YOY new purchase

What this means simply is everyone who can qualify/afford a home at this point is almost exhausted and new applicants are simply either not able to qualify or can't find a home with this inflated market. Eventually there will not be enough demand to satisfy once forbearance ends and supply hits the market.

Here we take a look at housing prices related to income YOY. This is wrong. We have wages either staying stagnant or dropping and everything else increasing? No get fucked.

Average Home Price YOY

Wage Growth Tracker

The media is filling our heads with lies of a housing shortage but that is quite the contrary. People who SHOULD have been foreclosed on or otherwise not able to meet requirements, were not due to the forbearance, thus supply has not gone up. *(Don't get me wrong, we needed this badly with how things went last year, but they should have ended sooner than all of this. If you are someone who needs it and uses it responsibly, you have my blessing)*. I know a lot of people who misused this setting and instead of saving that money they weren't spending, they bought new shit like guns and cars etc. The truth is, supply of houses are about to be high.

New housing starts

Here you can see that in fact housing development is at highest rates, or equal to in years. So what happens when all this new housing hits the market, forbearance ends and foreclosures begin? Well a lot of people lose their ass. Primarily the people who bought the top and now owe 400k on a home that's worth 360k. Again, this becomes the banks responsibility should the buyer not be able to weather the storm.

CPI Chart

Again we have a CPI Chart that only rises, which wouldn't be a problem, but oh wait, wages are stagnant or decreasing.

Here is one last visual before I go to dinner with my family and watch fireworks.

Delinquencies 30, 60, 90 days late all subject to foreclosure if the buyer cannot keep up.
