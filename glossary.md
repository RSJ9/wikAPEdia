To the best I can tell, it refers to a mechanism of price manipulation where one or more parties short at a specific price level to cause the price to drop and then proceed to do it some more after the price has dropped (hence, a ladder). |
| Short sale restriction (SSR) | When a security drops by 10% or more from the previous day's closing price, it gets put on short sale restriction. This prevents short selling on "downticks" (price movements downward). Once invoked, it's active until the end of the next trading day, provided that the stock doesn't re-trigger the effect. |

If the company goes bankrupt, then there's no need for covering. |

| Trading sideways | Periods of time where the price of a security does not move very much. |
