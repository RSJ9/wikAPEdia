Dec -> Mid June FTDs and Short Volume

I posted a few days ago about an app I've been working on, OP with a lot of details here:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9ouq9/built_a_web_app_with_lots_of_graphs_using_a_large/>

I've just parsed through and added the new June FTD data from the SEC, if anyone's interested, take a peek!

Data goes back to 2009, and covers a variety of things - short volume, total volume, Dark pool volume and more.

Hope it's useful!

Suggestions, feedback and so on is welcomed.
