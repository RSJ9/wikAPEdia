Fidelity Top Orders by Customers Update - Thursday July 15, 2021, buy orders = 88% & sell orders = 12%. Stonk is down $0.80 (-0.4773 %) on 4.2m volume. Orders ≠ share volume. Highest buy:sell order ratio that I have seen. Fells like its getting pumped up now in AH just to be dropped hard tomorrow 👀
