Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

Be sure to vote with your shares, don't think it won't matter because it does, over-voting would show there are lots of things being wrong and would give the company a much needed excuse to call their votes back in.

Also for the 6/9 (nice) annual shareholders meeting, remember that we will most likely not see a lot happen to the stock immediately after this because if they have something planned (NFT/Dividend/ recounting their own shares etc) it can be mentioned there but could still take some time before it can be implemented.

Like the NFT is set to launch around the 14th of July, if they were to give a dividend it could also be a few weeks, a recount can take a lot longer though, due to the audit process being very specific it may take a month or maybe longer (I can't say, or imagine, how long auditing the shares would take as this is a scale because the situation unprecedented) and there is a chance the vote count can be doctored to make sure it shows a non accurate vote count, regardless of everything just hodl and wait, as news reports have already stated SHF have list close to 2 billion usd just from Monday till Wednesday, but also these are "paper" losses as there is only an actual loss once they close their positions.

DFV IS BACK BABY!

After being silent for a few weeks our boy is back shitposting once again, even if he's not putting new DD forward or doing videos at the moment, but just seeing signs of life brings me joy to see.

Now there have been some people posting yesterday "oh we shouldn't look up to dfv, no hero worshipping" I'd say you're right, no one should be hero worshipped (we've seen this go wrong many a time) but DFV is our boy, a friggen time traveling cat so I'll just quote a person who is smarter then me to give a retort

" Authority is not given to you to, steward, to deny the return of the king."

There is also a theory going around as to why he went silent, and lets go over some of the logical ones. He was being sued in what may be called a "slap suit" a lawsuit making sure someone stays silent, his lawyers would have most likely advised him to stay silent for a while, to show there is no involvement between him tweeting and the price going up or not.

Meaning that at minimum his lawyers have said "yeah sure you can shitpost again", which is always a good sign! glad to have the king back, and would love to see him post here on superstonk, wsb or anywhere tbh, and I'm looking forward to him livestreaming once more.

And for the people who say "don't hero worship", he's the OG, he had the foresight none of us had, and none of us would be here today if he didn't see it first.

(caveat: even though he was the first and the og, we are not here because he is here, but because he raised a good point and that made us look into the stock of GME and we agreed on our own accord that it would be a good investment, we in no sense imply that Deepfuckingvalue himself has had any affect in our decision making.

The we in the above segment is the "royal we" so in no sense meant as "us" in a collective sense)

Short data

This was made by a friend of mine on twitter and shared publicly¬†[here](https://twitter.com/js76651030/status/1399852769058693120?s=27)

This data in and of itself does not tell us how much has been shorted, how many short/synthetic shares are out there, but it does tell us that they are shorting it even now, even at these high prices (high in contrast of the $3 usd we've seen last year where they started shorting it into oblivion), that in and of itself does tell us one thing, it's not over, and like Kenny said about the 2008 situation still Applies here and I'll paraphrase:"we where working every day to get one more day"

Keep going Kenny, dig me that infinity pool just a lil bit deeper plox <3

DTC-2021-005

Seems an awesome ape here finally got a response to their Foia request

as you can see in their thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nq2l2f/sec_acknowledges_foia_request_on_everything_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Bloomberg

Another awesome ape was kind enough to share some screenshots of their bloomberg terminal¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nq3o0g/01062021_gme_bloomberg_terminal_information/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I always love seeing these, my brain may be to smooth for me to completely understand this but I enjoy the bright colors on the screen, and the wrinkly brained smarties between us can explain quite a bit to us using these bright screens.

I have no clue what this means but something tells me.. something is up

Reverse Repo Rates

the reverse repo rates have decreased

But the amount of participants has also decreased. Past Friday saw 479.5 billion for 50 participants, and today's rate is 448 billion for only 43 participants.

Gamestop NFT

I've been seeing some misinformation about this in the past few days, this either stems from people not understanding it or not having all the info available, for those I'd advise checking this one out:

<https://gmedd.com/transformation/gamestop-unveils-official-nft-project/>

It has all the information currently available on the NFT so it would be a good start for anyone who feels like they need some help, or want some additional information.

The japanese are calling for our aid

And the Ameritards and Europoors will answer

[u/StupidMonsters](https://www.reddit.com/u/StupidMonsters/)¬†started a thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nq8idk/japanese_apes_calling_for_support_please_im/)

Going over some problems our Japanese apes are facing, give it a read and look if you can help in any way shape or form, what I've read so far I fucking love it, people have an issue and 300+k people pile in to see how they can help one and other <3

You want another Gamma?

Our in house wrinkle brained¬†[u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/)¬†just posted a thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqbera/things_are_shockingly_similar_to_the_february/)

in his own words a TLDR

> June 1st has kicked off with the DTC, ICC, OCC auction and wind-down plans officially being in place. This means it is OK to launch the rocket because those three entities are now protected. We're seeing very similar price movements and gamma squeeze signals compared to the previous T+35/T+21 runup that occurred from February 24th to March 10th. This means that we could very well see another gamma squeeze of similar or greater magnitude which would begin to go parabolic around June 9th.Note: This does NOT mean that a gamma squeeze WILL be coming. This is data supporting the fact that it COULD be coming. Do not take this as financial advice, and be aware that if you day trade you could miss the rocket.

Not saying there will be another Gamma right now, but it seems that there are some markers which would leave one to believe it's at least likely that we see something like that happen again.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Countdown to the Annual shareholder meeting 7 days to go

Edit 1: AnnihilationGod was kind enough to also research the trades starting April 1st, 53,40% of all gme shares traded during market hours were traded short.

<https://twitter.com/js76651030/status/1400035934716968963?s=21>

Edit 2: updated the Short data up top, AG had to make a change so I changed the image.

in his words:

> Looks like i got an error in my chart from yesterday - Doesnt change much - forgot to add the short exempt vol to Total short, this increases the number of shorts during market hour. This lead to an amount of 0.5% up to 4.4% of market hours shorts missing in my chart.

Edit 3: something went wrong with the formatting of the post so redid it.

Edit 4: DFV tweeted\
