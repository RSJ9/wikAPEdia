Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

The exponential floor thanks to¬†[u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/)¬†I wonder if the russel shuffle will affect this model today.

Also on that note

The Russel 1000

Please know that due to the idea of "front running" these ETF's we may see an uptick in volume today, but the actual buying of the ETF's will happen in the after hours as far as I was able to understand from the research of others.

as seen in this thread:

We could also see if the T+21 gets triggered today or that they let them turn into FTD's

But no matter what happens remember, this is the Water temple.

NSCC -005 delayed per the SEC

There seems to be some misconceptions I've seen forming about this one, this is the NSCC-005 that is delayed, not the DTCC-005 these are two separate filings.

[This is the DTCC 005](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-005.pdf)

[This is the NSCC 005](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-005.pdf)

The NSCC 005 is for Minimum Deposit Requirement Increase Proposal

Citadel was raided in Ecuador

source:

<https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/politica/allanan-las-empresas-decevale-y-citadel-por-el-delito-de-falsedad-de-informacion-en-el-sistema-de-mercado-de-valores-nota/>

Ok so I've heard a lot of speculation about this, and this is why I love our community, I've sent out a message on twitter asking for help on this, and ask and you shall receive!

so lets go!

Citadel in Ecuador has no ties to that we could find to Shitadel Chicago.

Yes it does have the same name "Citadel" but unless a name is a trademark or something like that, that would mean I could start a company with the same name, in the same or different country without a problem, even¬†[@Annihil4tionGod](https://twitter.com/Annihil4tionGod)¬†checked the Lei and found no connection.

- different presidents,

- different HQ addresses,

- different logo.

So until presented with different evidence, I believe we can write it off as "not THE Shitadel we know"

TOYS 'r' STOP

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-25-2021](https://preview.redd.it/g5arhce86d771.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d51877b19b4be097da06f8d6cf1f8ed46335263)](https://preview.redd.it/g5arhce86d771.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d51877b19b4be097da06f8d6cf1f8ed46335263)

I'm loving this, purely because about two weeks ago we had the glitch happen and Toys R us had the PUR/GME logo for a day or so.

But that had lead me to some rabbit hole and made a short thread here:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvw6kc/gme_and_toys_r_us/>

The thing comes down to a few basic things,

1.  toys R us is not a distraction, you can't buy their stock as it's not public

2.  backed by blackrock, the same guys who backed RC

3.  I believe the RC sears tweet may be related, as this would give a big space were they could put things.

4.  I miss Geoffrey ok?

But I do believe that if they expand in that area they would become more than just videogames, they could in theory become a one stop entertainment shop. again I have nothing solid but I feel like this may be a good thing to come.

Citadel-Owned Centricus Appoints Adam Aron As Director

On May 6, 2021, Adam Aron (of movie stock) was named director of Centricus Acquisition Corp in the Cayman Islands, a company which is owned by Citadel/Ken Griffin.

you can read more about it in¬†[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o78dhn/citadelowned_centricus_appoints_adam_aron_as/)

I don't want to spread FUD or say one shouldn't hold AMC or anything but, seeing the apes general consensus on Adam Aron's twitter feed (<https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1407881140371968001>)

I'd do some research into this and see if it holds any truth because if our boy RC was involved with Citadel in any way shape or form I would want to know.

Addendum:

What I meant with this is that Adam Aron seems to be involved with Citadel, if anyone in GameStop would be involved (for example Ryan Cohen or anyone else) I as a shaleholder in any of their ventures, I would like to get to the bottom of it.Because, if they are involved with "the other side" I would look into it, as it seems as a conflict of interest to me.I am not saying RC or anyone from GME is involved with Citadel, sorry if I didn't make that clear.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
