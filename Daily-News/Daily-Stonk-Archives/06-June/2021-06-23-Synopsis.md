Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

The Exponential floor by¬†[u/jth1](https://www.reddit.com/u/jth1/), I've also seen a picture floating around yesterday (unfortunately couldn't find it right now) that the exponential floor is now just delayed for 18 days, thats very awesome imo, as we can see the dip that started around the 6/9th was most likely due to the ATM offering, now it will be interesting to see how (and if) this changes the floor and how it will change.

002 and 801

Today is the day!

Today the 002 and 801 are going into effect, but do be sure that even if someone were to default today we wont see it happen today, it gives them an hour to respond to show enough liquidity (as far as I understood) and it could take between 1 and 5 days for them to become margin called, even IF they get called. remember all these rules and things are very complex and will take a bit.

as Mac loves to say "today could be the best day in our lives, or just another regular day"

I'm not in IBKR, but for every ape that is be sure to check your spam folder, check your account etc, because you don't want them to take action for you, you own your shares and you do with them what YOU want, not what they want.

Lucy Komisar article lays it all out

Meet the Investigators There are conflicting arguments about whether GME was a battle of long and short hedge funds, whether retail investors through Robinhood and other trading apps played a significant role, or maybe both.

Robert Shapiro, chairman of the economic advisory firm Sonecon and undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs under Bill Clinton, believes the war between hedge funds theory, with a healthy dose of "pump and dump" market manipulation and naked short selling. Shapiro has testified before the SEC and criticized it for failing to take effective measures against naked shorting.

Jeffries LLC raises price target.

Jeffries raises price target on GameStop. Expects a more digitally led business, see gamers as strong supporters both as consumers and investors: "We're monitoring the human capital changes closely as clues for what the new vision for the business will be."

good to know is that these are the guys who do the share offering for GME.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Thank you

[u/22012021](https://www.reddit.com/u/22012021/)¬†for finding this, this is the chart I saw yesterday, it goes off the premise that the exponential floor is set back by 18 days due to the ATM, I'm very interested to see how (and if) this theory holds up and in what kind of way it will. credit goes to¬†[u/FuriousFred](https://www.reddit.com/u/FuriousFred/)¬†for thinking this one up!
