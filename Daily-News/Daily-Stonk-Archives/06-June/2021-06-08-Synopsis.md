Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

"SEC filing with the final results of voting...within four business days of the meeting date"

Just so people are aware you won't hear about the Vote count ON THE DAY itself, it will be a few days.

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-08-2021](https://preview.redd.it/kia93ama60471.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4332d87c4029c7678962b1233476411b20259352)](https://preview.redd.it/kia93ama60471.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4332d87c4029c7678962b1233476411b20259352)

Also another thing we do need to keep in mind is that even though we'll be getting the numbers we have heard from previous AMA guests that they can do everything they can to make it look like it isn't as bad as it is, I know because suddenly my Bank couldn't let me vote because there was an "error" with uploading all the people in the database for american voting and would be resolved the 18th.

So I have a gut feeling that we will have millions of users all around the world who will be fed some form of BS why they can't vote, and GME won't know about it.

Update on GME short Data

The following Data is from¬†<https://twitter.com/Annihil4tionGod>¬†he's great with data and I'm very thankful for him being so kind to provide this to us.

I can finally provide an update on GME Short data.

Dear fellow investors, I took me some time to produce all these charts, but its finally done! Heureka! I can give you an insight on "How to trick retails with data" - based on the data published by¬†[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://t.co/l9FCWviIol?amp=1)¬†for GME. 1/5

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-08-2021](https://preview.redd.it/ayg0432080471.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0868dac55b96962351708100bc329cc8cfea33a)](https://preview.redd.it/ayg0432080471.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0868dac55b96962351708100bc329cc8cfea33a)

As you can see below - I got another results for the Short Volume Ratio. But how is this possible? The next picture will tell you why. 2/5

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-08-2021](https://preview.redd.it/8sxo42z280471.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcbcf9fbdc594ac70d0484e54064c1b3ded6be23)](https://preview.redd.it/8sxo42z280471.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcbcf9fbdc594ac70d0484e54064c1b3ded6be23)

Instead of calculating the Short Volume Ratio = Reported Shorts in Data you use / ( Reported Volume in Data you use / 100 ) -¬†[@fintel_io](https://twitter.com/fintel_io)¬†decided to use: Reported Shorts in Data you use / ( Total Daily Volume / 100 ) Perhaps just a mistake, fixed that for you - oh SVR is high. 3/5

Last but not least a short comparison of¬†[http://fintel.io](https://t.co/pCTwICFshn?amp=1)¬†and me. - And to conclute the results shortüì∑: The Short Volume Ratio is way higher then¬†[http://fintel.io](https://t.co/pCTwICFshn?amp=1)¬†is reporting what could mislead investors. 5/5

So Judging by this I AM BULLISH MY BOYS!

the fact that an institution like Finra and Fintel are able to blatantly manipulate their numbers in such a way and still be able to get corrected by a couple of smooth brained apes is amazing in my book and not in a good way, which also wraps up nicely into my next point.

The Russel 1000

You've most likely been hearing a lot of this in the past week, and just like me you have no clue what the difference is/was with the russel 1000 and 2000, what it means and how it works.

Thank god for smarter apes like¬†[u/Region-Formal](https://www.reddit.com/u/Region-Formal/)¬†for making awesome threads like this one¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nu91kx/russell_1000_many_poorly_researched_or_purely/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

he goes over the facts of what the difference is, what it can mean for the stock price what it can mean when it moves and everything you should know about the topic.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
