Good morning everyone!

I hope you all enjoyed your long weekend and did something fun!

The meme's

First of all I want to start with our meme lord, Elon musk.Some time ago he posted being the "destroyer of shorts" and the part of "this being Inevitable" well lets blow your mind.Tesla is one of the most hated stocks on Wallstreet itself, hedge funds, short sellers etc have used billions to short the tesla stock over time.In fact it got so bad that Elon made some "red shorts" to make fun of the short sellers.But here is the plot twistBecause Elon and Tesla bought 1.5 billion in bitcoin, that purchase made the price of bitcoin shoot up by thousands of dollars. But here is the fun part, That purchase triggered a $1.2 Billion price short squeeze, the same thing as GameStop but with Bitcoin.then he added the bitcoin tag on his twitter and triggered another squeeze of 612 million dollars.

So it's like this tweet is a subtle message to the short sellers, you're going against the memes, you're going to lose, so in a sense "this was inevitable".

FUD campaign

So you've seen a lot of trolls, shills and Melvin's on the board recently right?Don't expect this to be over in the next weeks.basic psychology works in several ways, the ones we have seen so far is negative reinforcement.telling you to sell, telling you that you made a bad decision the works.But one we need to be careful fore is another one, positivity bias.They can tell you that your wildest dreams will come true by Friday, everything HAS to happen this week etc etc.The squeeze will happen, don't put a timer on it.If you put a timer on this you will get disappointed because melvin will try to kick the can down the street for as long as he can.So sit back, relax and let it happen.don't set a date for yourself, or your fellow men around you.we got this, just stop putting timers on this.

Something we will also see is trolls, shills and melving try to discredit members.This is due to something called "the prisoners dilemma"to give you a better idea of what it is see this page:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma>

Don't fall for easy tactics folks, always ask yourself "What does the other side have to gain by saying/doing this?"

You'll most likely have seen posts ridiculing or trying to put [u/davidnio](https://www.reddit.com/u/davidnio/) down.I've personally read his work and agree with almost everything he has written.He has been a tremendous help to the community so don't take the word of someone who wants to easily discredit him, read his work and do your own do diligence.Every DD post you see here should be checked and double checked.

The play at hand here is simple:Take out Tom Brady and Tim Tebow, and you might have a chance at the game.Cripple them both you don't just have the game you have the full season.

Senator DFV

The senate hearing:

In the next week we will be seeing something special.the words "stonks" "roaring kitty" and "deepFUCKINGvalue" will be added to the congress books.A lot of people are worried about what's going to happen to DFV.Don't be!Just a few examples on what we have received:

WSB has fallen all hail the new WSB.

WSB hasn't been the same since january, we can all agree on that.But the thing is, a lot of people there still like GME.they just get banned, deleted or other.check this post <https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lkfojv/weekend_discussion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

Gme is still on top of the users list.<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lkjhee/wsb_mods_are_deleting_extremely_valuable_posts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

Now Ladies and gentlemen, lets move onto our main course!

XRT

I've read several posts and articles about this in the past days.And got to say... it seems like we have them at the balls<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious_researchers_needed_now_i_think_i_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt_is_being_used_to_hide_gme_shorts_xrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

<https://sixfigureinvesting.com/2010/09/short-squeeze-on-etf/>

As far as I can piece it together it's fairly simple.They moved their mailing address but still own the house. Meaning in very simple english, they may be hiding their short GME within the XRT ETF. because XRT is 4% gme.

As always if I have missed anything Please feel free to say so and I'll add everything needed.

Again not financial advice, just data I found everyone should know!

Edit:

Gamestop is stepping up!

Ok a few things need to be addressed!\
First of all it seems that Gamestop has now officially rebranded!\

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ll23al/gamestop_changes_its_logo_to_gme_the_gamestopcom/>

Their website is currently offline, this is normal when you delete a webpage and upload a new one.\
So expect some big changes on the website front!\
Also big news,\
Cohen just followed Elon Musk on twitter.

This may be in correlation of Tesla wanting to add gaming rigs in Tesla's\

Also Elon just changed his profile picture to this:
