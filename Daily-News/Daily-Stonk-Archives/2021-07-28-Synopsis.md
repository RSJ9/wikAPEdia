Expect price movement in the near future and if it doesn't then that would be even more interesting.

NSCC-2021-011 Rule change filing

[Rule Alert!

IlluminatiKev says in the comments "[Essentially, they used to be able to lump in institutional trades with normal trades through this ID Net Service, to expedite settlement AND to add the value of those institutional trades to their collateral calculation, but now they won't be able to add those values to the calculation & will need more collateral (!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osqksh/rule_alert_nscc_proposed_rule_change_filing_to/h6qj8wg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)" - comment byÂ [IlluminatiKev](https://www.reddit.com/user/IlluminatiKev/)

Horror_Veterinar goes more into what this filing means " The main purpose of this filing is toÂ *MORE ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE RISK WHEN THE NSCC MUST LIQUIDATE PORTFOLIOS DUE TO MEMBER DEFAULT*Â " it's a relatively easy read so give it a look.

Horror_Veterinar have looked at the new DTC-2021-014 filing enough to make another post, that said it's way beyond me.

[As SEC Chairman Pushes His Attorneys, Some Are Choosing the Door | Law.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osm7u2/as_sec_chairman_pushes_his_attorneys_some_are/)Â -Â [u/SG_Retard](https://www.reddit.com/user/SG_Retard/)

Sounds like Gary Gensler is forcing the sec attorneys to harden up and do proper work which ofc some of them don't like and chose to leave instead, I think this is the first piece of news that shows that Gary Gensler is actually doing something at the sec. And we can probably assume a big reason that it's taking so long is because there is probably a big pushback from the senior management.

hooper359 have been looking at GameStop subdomains and have found a new one ipfs.nft.gamestop.com he and the comments go into what ipfs means and the possibilities for it.

[Level Up - GME moving into the S&P500 could happen soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osnbhb/level_up_gme_moving_into_the_sp500_could_happen/)Â -Â [u/Latespoon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Latespoon/)

GME qualify for all requirements except one to join the S&P500 and that is to have four consecutive quarters earnings net income and if GME posts any positive earnings this quarter then they qualify for it, that said the S&P500 committee needs to decide if GME should be allowed to join but Latespoon thinks it's quite likely that they will let GME in, this could possibly have a big positive effect on GME's stock price so if you have something that you want to buy go and check if GameStop is selling it to give them better earnings.

[GME Is Micro-Gapping During Trading Hours... There's No Liquidity To Fill a Spread...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osoibk/gme_is_microgapping_during_trading_hours_theres/)Â -Â [u/ThatGuyOnTheReddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatGuyOnTheReddits/)

Due to the volume when someone buys or sells... the price change is increasing, basically, when someone buys (or sells) instead of the price going from 179 to 179.2 it's going from 179 to 179.8 (imaginary numbers) and while this has apparently been going on for some time now, it's really starting to get noticeable.

[UPDATED | NSCC-2021-002 has the SHF against the ropes. The next run-up may trigger the MOASS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osurpl/updated_nscc2021002_has_the_shf_against_the_ropes/)Â -Â [u/humanisthank](https://www.reddit.com/user/humanisthank/)

humanisthank goes over the NSCC-2021-002 a little and the effects it is having and some speculation.

I have finished the system for the Daily stonk group and have contacted a couple of people that have shown interest in helping out, I don't know when it will start but I'm hoping for a test run for Fridays post.

And while I have been creating the system I realized I have delegated enough work to others and made it fluid enough that I could probably act as the editor/poster and keep on posting it, I probably won't get too involved in making the synopsis for the posts or finding posts but I can format it and ensure that the quality stays high. That said once I post The Daily Stonk I probably won't be able to interact with it if something happens or interact with the comments for 13 hours till I get home.

We will probably need 1 or 2 more people to help write the synopsis for posts, If you'd like to help slide me a dm, ideally if the system works as hoped you shouldn't have to devote more than 1 hour per normal day (or we might have to find more people)

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Edit removed/changed part of my "[CEO introducing himself to GameStop- I like his message about his plan with the company. "Technology led retailer"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osus09/ceo_introducing_himself_to_gamestop_i_like_his/)" comment.

Edit mistook S&P midcap 400 with S&P500 so I fixed some misleading comments.
