Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

Netflix hires one person for/from a game development studio... so that's why GME is down according to them.

Just imagine what they'll report once they figure out that gme poached top Amazon workers, it may be the reason gme is stable now... sarcasm btw

for the new apes on the scene this kind of stuff is fairly typical for mainstream media, Gme does good and goes down, no news

Another company even breathes, OH THIS IS WHY GME IS DOWN, without any correlation between companies.

Blackrocks insane earnings

As some of you (most likely all of you) know, blackrock is one of the biggest players on the block, they're also the guys who are backing Gamestop and Toys R us (yes TRU is still alive and kicking, but their stock is not publicly traded and blackrock is backing them both).

Personal theory of mine, GME will eat up TRU and also offer toys but that's for another writeup.

Now they had an insane earnings report and another ape did a write up on their earnings:

TMNT ON NES

Vanguard added 366k shares of GME to their ETFs!

[u/Turdfurg23](https://www.reddit.com/u/Turdfurg23/)¬†Has written a small piece on how Vanguard has added 366k shares of gme to their ETFS, you can check it out¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okz7jx/vanguard_added_366k_shares_of_gme_to_their_etfs/)

FTD's

thanks to¬†[u/Maximito](https://www.reddit.com/u/Maximito/), he has gathered the FTD data of GME

Now it would be interesting to start looking at ETF's and the stock itself, as we all know they've been using ETFS more than just the stock itself, so it would be interesting to see those get combined, and see how many are actually failed to deliver

Cashgrab

Now lets talk about the latest cashgrab, most of the people involved with this will most likely try to chew me out or not be happy about me saying this but HOLY FUCK my expectations were low, but god damn...

(Also for the people who are tagged in the post, I'm not sure if they are involved or just being tagged so it gets more exposure)

Alright lets talk about it :

Jesus Christ, tell me you're trying to profit off of a movement without telling me you're a grifter.

These guys are charging from 200 ish bucks to a 1000 bucks TO GO TO A CASINO

When confronted you'll get greeted with "BUT APES NEED A HOLIDAY" "WHY NOT SPEND IT WITH APES" "BUT ITS FOR THE APES"

I got one for you guys, a couple of things actually.

1.  the squeeze has not happened therefore its dishonest to say it's about vacation, it's about exploiting your userbase to get more cash

2.  If you think this is about GME/AMC/ANY STOCK, it's bullshit this is a cashgrab, cash apes could better spend on ANY stock they like

3.  Be sure to hit that Superchat to pay 1000 bucks to spend 2 minutes with a guy who streams...

But yeah, the squeeze has not happened yet, we are currently in the middle of everything and you're setting up a "festival" ? Victory has not been achieved, wtf is there to celibrate? by all means Plan some apefest stuff once it has happened, people have had their tendies.

This is using your "status" to exploit people.

This is also the easiest way to get to "Dox" people.

But in case you think it's just me, let me bring you some more tea.

So before you get some BS on "YoU'Re JuSt MaD BeCaUsE iT's AMC" nah you idiot, I'm mad that you're trying to exploit people, and guess what? so does most of your user base.

You want to party? awesome go have fun, I'd honestly advise people to go out on the weekend, have fun and relax. But if someone wants you to pay to hang out with them... big no no.

On that final note, it's friday, it can either be the best day of our lives, or just a regular friday like our buddy Mac loves to say, but it will be interesting nonetheless! especially with all those juicy options on the board today üòâ

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

ALSO DONT TRY TO EXPLOIT YOUR FANBASE, THIS WOULD ALSO BE EXCELLENT!

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
