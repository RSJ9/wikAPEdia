AAAAAAND the bonds market seems like they're going to shit as well, may be a good thing to start looking into as well

Alright let's start with the one thing that's been doing the rounds here

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 07-13-2021](https://preview.redd.it/m3fyj1j52ya71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9084774ded6a7eed8652e23eaf8c34cbca9dbb92)](https://preview.redd.it/m3fyj1j52ya71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9084774ded6a7eed8652e23eaf8c34cbca9dbb92)

Some facts that make this tweet stand out:

Normally Gamestop tweets from the "Salesforce - Social Studio"

The GMERICA tweet was sent from twitter web app, meaning it's someone that's not part of the salesforce, it's been often hypothesized that this could be RC himself.

the GMERICA has a few theories around it.

1.  The usa has 330 million inhabitants, it could be that they're trying to say there are so many shares out there, or at minimum in the usa.

2.  GME is currently hiring 49 people on USA military bases, so could perhaps link to that?

3.  could be that GME has struck a deal with the military to be on more bases or something like that?

4.  usa's motto has been "e pluribus unum" out of the many the one, showing unity, perhaps something to do with that?

At the end of the day it's unknown what they meant with this, but it's fun to speculate regardless.

Also as I've seen people speculate on their signature at the end of some tweets

The SEC sent Wall Street a reminder: Companies cannot prohibit or impede employees from contacting the SEC or any other regulator about potential securities law violations.

Gme starting to get momentum

<https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-expands-fulfillment-network-new-facility-york>

As Gme said in may "we got a new fulfilment center", less than a month and a half later it's up and running, just to get an idea this is something that usually takes months and doing it so fast... damn now that's impressive!

Seems there is a pattern to be found

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oix58q/gme_seems_to_mirror_itself_almost_straight_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

it seems that pwnwtfbbq has found some correlations between the movement that GME has had and is currently having.

Again the pictures look promising but we'll have to wait and see her Maths to know if it's true or not.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Also for the people who keep commenting "nothing new", congrats dude it's a roundup of the information I've seen for the past day, this is for people who may have busy lives and don't have the time to browse the sub all day every day, and making sure they also have the same information as we have.\
This is supposed to be like a paper, a roundup, not a new DD
