Good Morning Apes,

After the positive response to yesterdays Daily Stonk, I have decided to continue making them, at least for now as I am and will be on vacation (at home) for 2 weeks but after that, we will see how long I will keep it up as I do work long hours (4 10 hour days per week) and that's only if I feel like continuing it for that long, which who knows, with that being said let's get into it.

Does anyone smell that?

Summary of criand's latest DD

[This is the step by step transaction, thank you u/criand in his latest DD, that shows how HF fill FTDs with option buy-writes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9ljo/this_is_the_step_by_step_transaction_thank_you/) - [u/Jabarumba](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jabarumba/)

Jabarumba has written up a kind of summary of criand's latest DD I'd recommend reading it because if I try to summarise his summary I don't think it wouldn't make sense anymore but it's not that long.

Recap of the last half-year

twincompassesaretwo made a simplified explanation and recap of the evens and DD's of the past half-year, if you're new to GameStop Stock then I'd recommend reading through it.

It seems Broccaaa have been removed from the mod list so I'm gonna presume that they did leave the mod team after all.

Yesterday I added 2 more posts after I posted, here are the links to them in case you missed them.

Yesterday there were many people who liked that I kept the same normal format and there were many who didn't and suggested that I make my own format or remove large parts of it, now you can't always please everyone but I believe keeping the format while taking out some of rensole's more personal parts like san diego is the best way to go about it, please let me know what you think about it.

Also before you wonder/ask yesterday "some people have asked me why I decided to make a daily stonk so here is a small writeup if you care <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/onab8m/the_daily_stonk_07192021/h5qnt07/?context=3> " in case you missed it.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock

u/BurnieSlander

BurnieSlander has a theory that the PG-13 might be a reference to Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock rather than a stock split, the theory is essentially to issue a dividend of a new stock attached to a blockchain not only forcing the SHF to cover but also giving us the real share count. Give it a read as it is a good theory.
