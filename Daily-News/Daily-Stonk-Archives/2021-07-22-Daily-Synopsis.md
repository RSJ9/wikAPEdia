Good Morning Apes,

Yesterday was a little hectic with the Automod removing comments and posts with double s in them but these things aren't uncommon and have been fixed.

Yesterday I asked for your opinion on keeping or removing the RRP and before the Automod issue, the response was strongly in favour of keeping it while keeping in mind that it is mostly only relevant to GameStop Stock as an overall market indicator and funny numbers go up which we all love so it will stay for now, Thank you for your input be it in favour or against.

Capital requirements violations, FINRA incompetency and Wolverine Execution Services short sales mismanagement

[I Ain't Hear No Bell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ooptc3/i_aint_hear_no_bell/) - [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt/)

The DD atobitt have been teasing about for the past few days have been posted and he goes into "violations for failing to properly maintain sufficient capital within customer accounts", a bit of FINRA incompetency and Wolverine Execution Services failing to properly report short sales as short sales, instead reporting them as long, failing to comply with locate requirements, failure to meet OATS reporting obligations and failure to record and preserve order event information.

Edit TD Ameritrade (Schwab) does not require a phone call either which is what I intended to share, my bad.

As the link says Fidelity is hiring 600 more workers in Covington " where it already employs around 4,700 people".

More than likely we won't really see any difference as per usual but that's still a load of FTDs.

[Start preparing yourself now for the most important journey you may ever take. Yes, we have the winning hand. But it's moot if people panic-sell on the way up.

Proposals under consideration

Removed image as it was too big so I will quote the tweet from domocapital " "There are over a dozen proposals under consideration, including ... requiring hedge funds to disclose any short-selling ... against stocks to the public." the disclosure rules should be the same for longs / shorts. Disclose if >5% of shares outstanding."

Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal starts in 5 days

too_techie goes a little into the Director of Enforcement role and Gurbir Grewal who will be the first Director of Enforcement that was not previously a defence lawyer but instead was a prosecutor and is "cautiously optimistic".

As you probably know dlauer have been working on starting a new platform to help provide retail investors with better information and a platform to utilize it, I think this is a great idea that will help many But I'd wait with any serious funding until after the MOASS as I and many think we should focus on one thing at a time, but good on dlauer for wanting to do good in the financial world and I hope it takes off.

Donar Advised Fund

Removed image as it was too big "JP Morgan: us banking giant gives boss 'special award'" "Banking giant JP Morgan Chase gave its chief executive a "special award", potentially worth millions of dollars.

I was going to link [u/natep001001](https://www.reddit.com/user/natep001001/)'s DD but I'm not really sure if it's too remote for GME, it's about leverage and the words might send Autobot on to me so you're gonna have to look for it yourself if you want to read it.

Due to the Automod issue yesterday, yesterday's daily got removed and I'm not sure if it is still up (it's up for me but in incognito it closes if you click it so idk) so just in case I will link all the posts from yesterday for those that missed it if you missed it.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Edit

The "I emailed Wealthsimple to clarify their position" post was a user contacting their own broker, not Schwab itself which is my mistake But another user made a post where they contacted TD Ameritrade (Schwab) and confirmed that "[TD Ameritrade DOES NOT require a phone call for selling shares above 10k or a sale total of > 1 Million! - Anyone that says otherwise is promoting FUD.
