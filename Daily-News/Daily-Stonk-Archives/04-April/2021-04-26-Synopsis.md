Good Morning Superstonk!

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily 04-26-2021](https://preview.redd.it/sggrybx9mev61.jpg?width=299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07b6bedb0d70813005fb2e3fdfd2e8217a7e9eef)](https://preview.redd.it/sggrybx9mev61.jpg?width=299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07b6bedb0d70813005fb2e3fdfd2e8217a7e9eef)

To ease the pain

So, it's Monday morning, the market opens in a few hours, you've got your coffee (or your beer for you Europoors) and you're ready to sit down and have a read of Rensole's daily DD....

Then you remember. And suddenly you feel worse than when your spouse asked you what happened to the Disneyland money you'd saved (YOLO, amirite?). Rensole's DD is no more, and a chapter in the GME saga has closed.Â *HODL me*Â ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

*This is a note to Rensole. Feel free to scroll down to Dr. Trimbath's picture if you're just looking for the Daily DD*Â ðŸ˜Š

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Before I begin, I'm going to tell you that without Rensole and his daily posts, Pink Cats- and a lot of the comradery of this sub- would probably not be here. After reading about GME since December on WSB, I bought my first share on January 18, 2021. And I've been buying and HODLing ever since. But for any of you apes from the jungles of January, you know that the dip after January 28th felt like a punch in the gut. February wasÂ *brutal*. I questioned my sanity, I cried in the shower, I mentally punished myself daily for continuing to hodl instead of just selling. I just threw my family's savings into something I've been reading about onÂ *reddit*Â FFS!!

But then we migrated toÂ [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), and our favorite Anchorman began showing up on our screens right on time every day.

And he never relented. I remember days when he was sick or didn't feel good. He still posted that beacon of hope, shining forever brighter, to lead all the apes into a new day of trading. How badly did you need that shit mid-to-late February? And Rensole was there to deliver rock steady words of stonkiness. It was like a hit of Hopium straight to the brain every morning. Friendships were built in those comments.

Although I know he would never admit it himself, this community wouldÂ NOTÂ be where we are today without Ren. The gratitude I owe him for getting me through the slumps and shrugs in this GME saga isÂ *infinite*. I never felt like I was HODLing alone. Thank you for all you've done for the apes. Though all you can hear sometimes are the haters, you have always been loved and appreciated by this community. Thank you for teaching us the power of being excellent to each other. We all owe you a beer on the moon. Cheers, Rensole and stay classy. :salute:

ðŸš¨BREAKING NEWSðŸš¨

AMA Confirmed with Dr. Susanne Trimbath, PhD Economist, to Livestream on Superstonk Live YouTube* April 29 at 3pm EST, With Questions curated and presented byÂ [u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/)

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily 04-26-2021](https://preview.redd.it/sn43dty7aev61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e41dfb3f784cb8e089e7ebbf52773aa9e9be053f)](https://preview.redd.it/sn43dty7aev61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e41dfb3f784cb8e089e7ebbf52773aa9e9be053f)

Dr. Susanne Trimbath, PhD Economist

*NON-MONETIZED CHANNEL

So the first time I heard about Dr. Susanne Trimbath ([bio](https://www.gminsight.com/bio-susanne-trimbath))was when I watchedÂ [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpyhnmd-ZbU&t=2217s). (Skip to 16:50 if you're just looking for the Dr. T bits but I suggest you watch this whole video when you have time.) This legend first discovered Naked Short Selling inÂ *1993.*Â And what was the response from officials when she told them about this activity? "You can't balance the world."

Well I don't know about you apes but I'm ready to balance the damn world.

So that brings us to Brick Tamland ([u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)) with more info on this developing story...

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily 04-26-2021](https://preview.redd.it/acasio0h8ev61.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00482ba6d647b34a211e9a5dc067ed42b7cbe722)](https://preview.redd.it/acasio0h8ev61.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00482ba6d647b34a211e9a5dc067ed42b7cbe722)

Brick Tamland (u/Bye_Triangle)

We interrupt your regularly scheduled programing for some Breaking news

*Queue News-like music sting*Â *Susanne Trimbath... Now this AMA is going to be a heavy-hitter.*

Trimbath has a history that is very applicable to our current situation. Once the manager of the DTC, specifically working in Settlement and Clearing, Trimbath spent much of her career trying to destroy the corruption of Wall Street, with regards to Naked Short selling.

Authoring two books on the subject of Wall Street corruption, Trimbath is eager to take this opportunity to speak to us apes about this very topic as it relates to the GME situation, but also the markets as a whole.

Please, check out her books on the topic, they are extremely relevant:

-Naked, Short and Greedy: Wall Street's Failure to Deliver

-Lessons Not Learned: 10 Steps to Stable Financial Markets

But Apes, Guess what! We saved the most exciting announcements for last. Not only are we having Susanne Trimbath on for an AMA... but it is going to be a livestream on our new ***NON-MONETIZED***Â [Superstonk Live YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/9rKS92zwh_o)! Mods have been working through the night to build a platform that apes can trust to host interviews such as this. (Stay tuned for more details on the channel.)

Though, unlike the Domo Capital AMA, we will have one of our very own apes hosting the Q & A, with questions sourced from the AMA post as well as drawing from their own expertise. This person recently wrote a certain DD called "House of Cards" ...Â That's right folks, your very ownÂ [u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/)Â is our host!Â Atobitt has been hard at work preparing for this interview, so you are going to want to stay tuned so you don't miss this.

Tuesday, April 27th The AMA post will go up (for you to submit questions!)

Thursday, April 29th, 3:00 PM EDT the AMA will be LIVE!Â [Link to YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/9rKS92zwh_o)

Back to you,Â [u/PinkCatsonAcid](https://www.reddit.com/u/PinkCatsonAcid/)

GME wants YOU to VOTE (no, REALLY!)

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily 04-26-2021](https://preview.redd.it/69zvcn8h7ev61.jpg?width=842&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ee1ffc35c04359b5f85c8704a910588203ad631)](https://preview.redd.it/69zvcn8h7ev61.jpg?width=842&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ee1ffc35c04359b5f85c8704a910588203ad631)

Vote!

So our friendÂ [u/StonkU2](https://www.reddit.com/u/StonkU2/)Â did an awesome writeupÂ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxhcnq/beware_phishing_scams_are_trying_to_steal_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)Â about the upcoming GME Proxy Vote. Essentially you need to make sure that you understand the following:

-   Your broker should contact you with proxy voting info and your Shareholder Control Number. This will likely show up in your broker inbox on your main dashboard sometime this week, if it hasn't already. But if you haven't gotten it yet today, don't freak out yet. I know I'm going to wait until at least Tuesday or Wednesday before calling to retrieve my Control Number because most brokers should have this info out by mid-late this week. Of course, it's ultimately best for you to check with your broker yourself if you ever have questions.

-   DO NOT LET GO OF THIS CONTROL NUMBER WHEN YOU GET IT. APE PROTECC TICKET TO ROCKET SHIP LIKE IT WAS GOLDEN BANANA. GOT IT? That means don't go clicking phishy looking links around Twitter or reddit or ANYWHERE that isn't sent directly from your broker! I can however verify that the correct link is:Â <https://news.gamestop.com/proxy-online-0>Â . This is the only place you should be sharing the Control Number!!!

-   Did you hear me?Â DO NOT CLICK ANY LINK TO VOTE THAT DOESN'T COME DIRECTLY FROM YOUR BROKER.Â Pretend it's 2001 and you're downloading sketchy "music videos" on Limewire on the family computer. Just be vigilant.

Now that I've made that point clear, I want you to understand how important it is that every shareholder exercises their right to vote. And that's not anyone's personal opinion, and don't let Shilly FUD tell you that you're somehow orchestrating something by exercising your right to vote.

Gamestop is asking shareholders directly to VOTE ASAP!!!

Allow me to read you this excerpt from the 2021Â [Gamestop Proxy Statement](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18846/html):

*"Your*Â *vote*Â *is important. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we request that you vote your shares*Â *as soon as possible*Â *by following the voting instructions contained in this proxy statement."*

as well as:

*"We are*Â *planning for the possibility that the ANNUAL MEETING MAY BE HELD SOLELY BY MEANS OF REMOTE COMMUNICATION.*Â *If we take this step we will announce the decision to do so in advance of the Annual Meeting, and detail on how to access, participate in, and*Â *VOTE*Â *at such meeting will be set forth in a press release"*

So not only are theyÂ SCREAMING AT US TO VOTE AS SOON AS POSSIBLEÂ (after your broker contacts you about it), they're also telling us that they're discussing a way to livestream it and let us apes in on the action in real time. Of course we will keep you updated here on the Daily, but also stay on top of your broker situation. Looks like something should be officially released by April 28, 2021 as far as details from Gamestop.

A note from your friendly local Pink Cat

If this is your first time reading my material, Hi! I'mÂ [u/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://www.reddit.com/u/PinkCatsOnAcid/)Â and I've been here in the GME Jungles ofÂ [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), thenÂ [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), and now my lovely home ofÂ [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/). I've been memeing and vibing with my apes from the first drop of the Tendieman. I love this place. I am legitimately honored that I have been entrusted to help steer this rocket. I am going to echo whatÂ [u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/)Â has said and swear to you this right now...

I WILL NEVER SELL OUT OR SELL ALL MY GME

If you ever see me posting something totally not PinkCats-like, I've been compromised. Y'all know I'm just a trippy cat that likes to meme and sometimes I hack up word-balls. And you know how much I like the stock. I'm not interested inÂ *money,*Â I'm interested inÂ *GME Tendies.*

I will never sell all my GME and I will never sell out this reddit account. You have my word.

I love you crazy mf-ers and I ain't going anywhere. You're stuck with me. ðŸ’ŽðŸ’…ðŸš€

Committed to you like Kenny to his shorts

Also, if I didn't get to you in yesterday's Flair Megathread, I will! I promise! And I will be doing another one very soon. That was fun and I had to cut it short to do boring mod stuff and fight some shills. ðŸ”« But we will resume on another weekend!

More Notes on FUD tactics

If you haven't yet, please read our Reigning Queen Red'sÂ [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx887u/code_red_subreddit_weekend_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). She said it beautifully so I won't rehash here. Just beware of the new age psy-ops happening in this sub. And the mod team is taking extensive measures to crack down and clean up the page without limiting the free flow of conversation. I can tell you this- I certainly won't use the ban hammer with a heavy hand, but I think y'all know by now I have a nose for bullshit and won't tolerate any nonsense in here. The mod team is not afraid to ban an obvious shill. And remember... if you look and talk like a shill, we are probably going to mistake you for one. We're working very hard to clean house around the sub before our guest arrives. Bring facts and research with your posts, especially if requested to provide proof of claims. I've lost 2 subs. I'm not letting you take my Superstonk, shills.

In the words of Rensole...

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!
