None of this is financial advice,

Senpai is with us

Ok let's start with something that completely made my day yesterday.

For some time now we were noticing some big awards being given anonymously, the way that Gamestop literally spells shit out sometimes, or how their tweets/merch seem to match up with what we were saying (squeezable cat toy available 4/20).

Yesterday we got some hard AF confirmation bias.

I came across the meme fromÂ [u/Buttfarm69](https://www.reddit.com/u/Buttfarm69/)Â and replied with that to pixel on twitter, for just some fun.

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-09-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/8knu1kbt44s61.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c816ef151f46c2c20aca03277bfed950ef0d3c)](https://preview.redd.it/8knu1kbt44s61.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c816ef151f46c2c20aca03277bfed950ef0d3c)

and guess who also tweeted that same image some hours later?

So why do I care so much?

Because this shows he's either;

A) paying attention to what we are doing on the subs

B) paying attention more directly to the people involved

C) just happened to see it (seeing how involved he is with his customers this seems to be the less likely option to me).

So on the off chance RC is watching,

Hi!

Are you drinking enough ? getting enough rest? please do.

know our community loves what you are doing with GME, and know we got your back. We are all excited to see the roadmap and all the other things you'll bring to the table with the shareholders meeting, and congrats on getting that dream team on the board!

one of us, one of us

Chairman? but... ceo?

So there seems to be some confusion here on the subs as to why people are excited for RC to become the Chairman, but we thought we wanted him to become CEO?

Oh my sweet little chimp let me do a small run down of company hierarchy for you.

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-09-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/tleebhmu64s61.png?width=1469&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe61bc704e424d2da9c2139b3d25c100e301dfc)](https://preview.redd.it/tleebhmu64s61.png?width=1469&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe61bc704e424d2da9c2139b3d25c100e301dfc)

What it basically comes down to is that the Chairman is top dog of the company, if the CEO wants to do any major changes to the company he needs the approval of the Chairman, but here is the fun part, did you know that often the CEO and Chairman of the board are the same person? this because it saves hassle and just makes it easier, this usually is something that depends on how the company want's to do it. but it does not excluding him from becoming a CEO as these functions are not mutually exclusive.

so let's do a quick rundown of the 8k

> GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 08, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company") today announced that it is nominating the following six individuals to stand for election to its Board of Directors (the "Board") at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") on June 9, 2021: Alan Attal, Larry Cheng, Ryan Cohen, Jim Grube, George Sherman and Yang Xu.

Alan Attal, Larry Cheng, Ryan Cohen, Jim Grube, George Sherman, and Yang Xu.

Ok these six people are up for being nominated to a director position nothing wrong with that right? only look a bit closer, GEORGE SHERMAN is on the list, the current CEO.

So anyone feel the wrinkle forming ?

If mr. Georgy boy is already in the CEO position why is he on the nominations list? this means that there are a few options with this.

A) He wants to remain CEO and can only do so by vote

B) he wants to be CEO but the rest does not, so they have to put it to a vote

C) he is willfully stepping down from the CEO position, but he would like to stay on board.

D) this is just a way for him to gracefully step down?

Tldr; our boy is Chairman of the board, but can also become the ceo.

But there is more good news in that respect, remember earlier in the week GME put out a statement saying they could issue about 3.5 million shares extra and people lost their shit, but if you read the filings from yesterday you'd know that the new board will be paid in shares.

so how is this good?

BECAUSE THE BETTER THEY MAKE THE COMPANY THE MORE THEY GET PAID!

this means if they do a shit job they get shit pay, they make the company the next amazon these guys get more bang for their stock, this is as bullish as it gets.

RC came out of the gate and said, nah pay me in shares instead of normal wages, this not only shows commitment but also is a direct incentive to perform and not just for him no the entire board!

<https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-110500597.html>

Also because people seem confused by this in the 8k let me try and explain.

BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT(S) IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THE PROXY STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING AND THE PARTIES RELATED THERETO.

The entire "we can vote" thing will be pertinent to those statements, we are still waiting for those statements to be released, we don't know as of right now when they will be coming out, could be today or next week for all we know.

For the new apes, I've seen some things pop up like "this is good news why is the share price going down?"

To you I say, Hi welcome to the shit show we call the US stock market!

For some weird reason every time we get some good news GME get's hit hard down, this is because if people fomo back in, or the price get's to high the shorts will have to cover (this is called a margin call) and don't expect them to just give up, they will throw everything and the kitchen sink at this to try and prolong the inevitable.

Don't expect all of this to be over in a day or a week, Dr. Burry had to wait for 2 years, but he was alone, we are now in the hundreds of thousands of people all invested in the same company, this has more scrutiny then anything we have seen so far. so be realistic in it's timeframe, it can take days or weeks or months we don't know, it could go any minute for all we know.

so onto the 4/20

[u/mark-five](https://www.reddit.com/u/mark-five/)Â was kind enough to poke me yesterday and I did some checking.

The date of record is the date they "count" your GME as set in stone for how many shares you can vote. Any shares purchased after that won't be counted and you can't vote them.

It's NOT A CUTOFF TO RETURN SHARES! There is no cutoff.

What happens instead of a set cutoff date is short interest rates start getting increased. It's like 1%. It will go over 100% and then over 200% as Citadel drags this on, climbing and climbing to force the returns of shares they literally can't cover - until they get margin called.

The climbing interest rates are going to make daily short attacks much more expensive too. Things will be interesting for the next few weeks.

Also for some of the more smooth brained apes out there, DO.NOT.MAKE.AGREEMENTS.ON.WHEN.TO.RECALL!!

if people make agreements to take any action together this is market manipulation, and trust me, the governing bodies may not go after Citadel right now but they will come down on individuals.

it's illegal, so if anyone wants to make an "agreement" on when to do something, it's permaban.

Also check if your brokers don't lend out your shares if you don't want them to, don't post here DOES X BROKER, NO! call or contact your broker directly and ask them. everyones account can be different and handled differently. get confirmation from your broker, not a stranger on a sub.

Also people complained about Blackrock not voting last year, so check this

<https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/fact-sheet/blk-responsible-investment-engprinciples-global.pdf>

Pg. 11 talks about Blackrocks philosophy surrounding proxy voting.

In general, it says they will choose to vote if there is benefit to shareholders. If the shares are held in a fund, the fund manager has full discretion on whether to vote or not.

These are the people who've backed Cohen since his Chewy days, you think they'll want to get some good investment and make money or make some pennies by lending out the shares this year?

I know what I would do if I where them.

SEC

So anyone else notice something funny with these guys?

Yesterday they were supposed to have a closed doors meeting which got cancelled... hmm lets look into that a bit more.

SEC "Sunshine Act Meeting" Cancelled

<https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events>

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-09-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/5cxgkoujc4s61.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=98941a402c44719af25d63c64c6162d5d1a9ef56)](https://preview.redd.it/5cxgkoujc4s61.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=98941a402c44719af25d63c64c6162d5d1a9ef56)

And the SEC moved the meeting to April 15.Â <https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg041521.htm>

Ok so what else?

[![r/Superstonk - Synopsis for 04-09-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/8sd85a5nc4s61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3bfc92a16fdd17c75135af41151656bdc6bd45c)](https://preview.redd.it/8sd85a5nc4s61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3bfc92a16fdd17c75135af41151656bdc6bd45c)

This can mean a few things

A) she didn't do her job and got canned

B) she just wanted to get out and do something else?

C) they knew she was somehow involved and wanted her out

D) she was just in the meeting but because they need that head in that meeting they needed to postpone (but they only postponed till the 15th so... dunno)

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.

And I'll be posting updates as they happen here:

One last thing before I go for the weekend, if I can give you some homework for the weekend to research let it be this, Exit strategies.

This is something that's often overlooked in the grand scheme of things, we have been so focused on everything happening to the moon, but most people have overlooked what exit strategy they will use.

Research this and make your own decisions on how you want to tackle you strategy.

Make up your own mind, and make your own exit strategy.

Enjoy your weekend guys!

one small Edit, Even though 4/20 is looking promising to be an important date, remember we DONT DO DATES! RC got announced to become chairman yesterday and the stonk went down, for that same reason don't hold on to dates, whatever will come shall come.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swt-WAD2AKU&ab_channel=Gollum>

The stonk is like Gandalf

Guess who's back?

Wade is back!

<https://twitter.com/TheWouston>

on the 4/20 date.

[u/Addicted2Tendies](https://www.reddit.com/u/Addicted2Tendies/)Â wrote:

IMPORTANT: The 4/20 recall information is incorrect. The record date is the date on which shareholders and their holdings are registered with the company. Shareholders who are not listed in the record on the record date cannot vote. Likewise, this applies to loaned out shares. If loaned-out shares are not returned to the original owner by the record date, they do not get voting rights on those shares. 1 share = 1 vote, so this means that however many shares you want to vote you must be in ownership of them on the record date of 4/20. Not saying that BlackRock, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, etc., will choose to recall their shares, but if they want to, delivery of shares is T+2 which gives a 4/16 deadline to issue a share recall notice. This also means that any shares purchased on 4/19 will not increase voting power as they will not be in ownership until 2 days later. After a share recall is issued, any shares not returned T+2 will result in an FTD and could potentially result in a buy-in from my limited understanding.

I've now heard so many conflicting statements so I'll refrain from posting anything regarding the 4/20 from now on.
