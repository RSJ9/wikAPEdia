Good Morning Apes,

Thursdays are usually a slower day but man was it slow yesterday, I think I only found 1 interesting post for 6 hours after I posted the daily.

Edit My work schedule has been changed from evening to morning which means I will not be able to upload the Daily Stonk in the morning at the same time as I can't use drafts on my phone.

The Daily Stonk will be moved up by 6 hours to when I get home, that is about 1 hour after the markets open, starting Monday. The Daily Will also continue as a group effort if you have missed it.

So yesterdayÂ [u/TuaTurnsdaballova](https://www.reddit.com/user/TuaTurnsdaballova/)Â found 1M put option on the Bloomberg terminal but they seem to have disappeared now and been replaced by 540k put options from credit suisse hedging-Griffo another Brazilian hedge fund owned by credit suisse, very strange, was it another bug? or something else? that said I feel like something like this has happened before but with something else and was debunked so be careful with these terminal snapshots and take a second look into the records.

Gary Gensler also made a follow-up tweet that not many saw InÂ [his second tweet](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1420791000692371458)Â he links his congressional hearing testimony from mayÂ <https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-20210505>

[People are missing the point of the Gary Gensler tweets and there is more to it than meets the eye, just like Ryan Cohen.

apegoneinsane goes a bit into the may testimony and that "he can't go around showing his hand too early".

Sounds like Credit Suisse was really close to being margin called (not liquidated) back in January during the runup.

Now I don't know if this means the bill has passed to be implemented or if it has been passed to be sent to be voted on by congress.

China has been having trouble with a housing bubble for some time now and the situation with evergrande could cause risks in the global financial markets, this isn't very relevant to GME besides adding instability in the market so you could probably skip it if you want to.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
