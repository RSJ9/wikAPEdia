Good Morning Apes,

I don't have anything interesting to say today so let's get straight into it.

[Criand](https://www.reddit.com/user/Criand/) made some interesting comments where he thinks the reason why the RRP is increasing so much is because the market is taking up all the t-bills (treasury bills) forcing government money market funds to turn to the RRP instead, take a look as it's interesting. <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oteezg/daily_reverse_repo_update_0728_965189b/h6uro7d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3> - [Criand](https://www.reddit.com/user/Criand/)

[Satori, a look into the mind of a robot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otiyf6/satori_a_look_into_the_mind_of_a_robot/) - [u/Captain-Fan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Captain-Fan/)

Team Satori has made a bittersweet post devolving a little bit of how Satori works in order to settle some speculation and concerns, at the potential cost of making Satori less effective. The main takeaways are Satori does not collect any non-public data, does not ban users or take an active role in moderating other than as a supplementary information tool, can only approve 100 users per hour due to Reddit restrictions and Team Satori knows exactly how Satori makes its predictions.

[Pinception - DD, Mod Announcements, and everything else we want to pin at the same time: A Test Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otpvr7/pinception_dd_mod_announcements_and_everything/) - [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/)

As Reddit only allow the mods to pin 2 posts at a time they are testing making a pinned post, post where essentially most posts that should be pinned will be put into instead, it is currently in testing but this will allow the mods to collect more things at the top such as a collection of DD that many have requested.

[GameStop to Rebrand EB Games in Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ot7f7j/gamestop_to_rebrand_eb_games_in_canada/) - [u/canhazreddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/canhazreddit/)

A lot of Canadians have been hoping and asking for GameStop to rebrand EB game stores to GameStop and they listened, from the ​News Release "This decision follows our receipt of feedback from our valued customers and stockholders" and "By the end of this year, EB Games' Canadian locations and online store will assume the GameStop brand and name."

Remember 1 put option "allow you to sell shares (generally 100 per contract) at a certain price by a certain time" so that's probably some 100 million shares, very strange.

Edit [Criand made a good comment about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otn94a/can_anyone_explain_the_over_one_million_put/h6x2h7a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that I saw thanks to [u/BohemianConch](https://www.reddit.com/user/BohemianConch/)'s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ottkv9/i_felt_criands_comments_drowned_in_the_latest_1m/).

Federal Reserve press release

[Inflation Alert! FOMC Update: Rates remain unchanged, asset purchases to continue at $120 billion per month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otfj67/inflation_alert_fomc_update_rates_remain/) - [u/Dismal-Jellyfish](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dismal-Jellyfish/)

The Federal Reserve has issued a press release about their monetary policy stance that they announced yesterday and Dismal-Jellyfish have Inputted the main bullet points of the policy. Since we are interested in the RRP the policy states "Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair"

I was going to include a post that had a link to the Federal Reserve Press Conference but I lost it so here is the link to the Press Conference at least <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipRReN74LXE>

[The Fed's New Repo Facility... and a fun little theory to jack your tits...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otmu2g/the_feds_new_repo_facility_and_a_fun_little/) - [u/leisure_rules](https://www.reddit.com/user/leisure_rules/)

The fed will/have released a New Repo Facility called Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility (SRF)

Essentially if primary dealers park their securities in the SRF then the Fed gives out cash in return at a rate of 0.25% if I understand it correctly.

[Why the inclusion in the S&P MidCap 400 has my Tits Jacked to the absolute MAX. This is NOT like the Russell 1000 inclusion which was waaaay overhyped.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ot3yv6/why_the_inclusion_in_the_sp_midcap_400_has_my/) - [u/tardnugget](https://www.reddit.com/user/tardnugget/)

tardnugget goes over that historically inclusion into MidCap 400 have had a positive price movement and an increase in volume the day after the announcement (07-28-2021) and the day of implementation (08-04-2021) and while we had negative price movement we did have almost 3 times the volume than previously.

House Committee Hybrid Markup Part 1

This is essentially a continuation of the "Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide." series where they present bills based on what they learned from it. From part of Waters opening statement "Finally, Representative Green's bill will make it a criminal act for market makers to trade ahead of their customers and will hold a CEO personally accountable if they trade ahead or engage in insider trading." that said these bills will still need to be voted on and according to the comments the likelihood of them passing is low.

[Court rules that SEC whistleblower protection extends to company shareholders, not just employees. "SEC Whistleblower Protection Rule Not Restricted to Employee Whistleblowers"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otqlza/court_rules_that_sec_whistleblower_protection/) - [u/NotsoPG](https://www.reddit.com/user/NotsoPG/)

"Securities Exchange Act Rule 21F-17 --- is not restricted to employees of a company, and extends to a company's shareholders" now I assume this is mostly only relevant to bigger shareholders but interesting nevertheless.

The Daily Stonk group is starting to get ready to start we won't be able to make a test run tomorrow but we should start over the weekend and release the first one on Monday if everything goes according to plans.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
