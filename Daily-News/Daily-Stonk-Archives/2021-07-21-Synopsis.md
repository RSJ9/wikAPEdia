Good Morning Apes,

Although there were a lot of memes and discussions, yesterday was a bit of a slower day on the news and DD side but that's fine, not every day can be full of news and DD.

Yesterday I got a comment concerning the RRP describing that the RRP has nothing to do with Gamestop stock or hedge funds or anything like that and got linked to an informative post that I will link explaining what repo is and told that there is no need to keep showing it. Now I have been under the assumption that the daily rrp posts were mostly just funny numbers go up kind of deal and it is liked by A lot of apes, Do you agree/disagree? And I want to ask do you want to continue to see the RRP at the top, do you want it removed or don't care either way?

Here is the link I'd give it a read if you want to gain another wrinkle (Note OldmanRepo was not the one that commented) [Repo 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olugxx/repo_101/) - [u/OldmanRepo](https://www.reddit.com/user/OldmanRepo/)

The Tokenist on Citadel Connect and possible abuse
==================================================

[In-Depth: Citadel Connect and Dark Pools Uncovered - The Tokenist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/onzbix/indepth_citadel_connect_and_dark_pools_uncovered/) - [u/ledonskim754](https://www.reddit.com/user/ledonskim754/)

The Tokenist make an interesting article about Citadel Connect whether it's a dark pool, if dark pools are being abused and if Citadel Connect is used to abuse. It's one of those rare articles that aren't too, too afraid to mention illegal shorting, financial abuse and corruption.

"Do you think Citadel Connect is used to benefit all parties involved through added liquidity---as [proclaimed by spokesmen](https://www.reuters.com/article/citadel-darkpool-idUSL2N0LQ17H20140221) from Citadel Securities? Or is there another part of the picture at play which is finally becoming uncovered**?*****"***

yelyah2 thinks Gamestop stock may continue to rise and believes that if it reaches $241 then things might get fun, and if it doesn't then we continue to HODL.

Massive informative post about the players and their game

&#x200B;

This massive post goes into " the institutional side of trading" detailing the players and their game, I have only skimmed it myself as it's so big but if you have the time you should give it a read and grow some more wrinkles, make sure to take a small look at the comments too as there are a few interesting things there as well.

Not much more to it than that, just more people leaving.

Yesterday I added 1 additional post [PG-13](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/onw3ie/pg13/) - [u/BurnieSlander](https://www.reddit.com/user/BurnieSlander/) (not to be confused with the meme above) and [a comment explaining the process](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/onw3ie/pg13/h5uq91q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) - [Adept-Ad5287](https://www.reddit.com/user/Adept-Ad5287/) if you missed it.

I think I'm mostly done overhauling the format as I think I got it to a state that works best for most, myself included and will let it mostly grow and evolve organically from here on, thank you all for your input.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

**We help each other, we care for each other.**

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!**

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

**We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!**

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
