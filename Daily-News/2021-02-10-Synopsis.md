Ok let's go people.

First of all I would like to start with the petition, we have gained a lot of traction with this and more then Quadrupled (!!!) the amount of people signed (going from 3k ish to signing to 12k)Keep this going and remember to share:

why you should sign it is explained here: <https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lfj97m/how_to_trigger_the_squeeze/>

A lot of threads are currently getting heavily moderated on WSB and it seems that it's still heavily compromised, so I will be linking from other boards, but trying to stay off of WSB as it's information is to be take with a grain of salt.WSB examples:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgjtg2/wsb_deleting_legit_posts_about_good_news_left_and/><https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgjibj/breaking_short_interest_7846/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

**The best kind of morale boost:**Ladies of GME are supporting us in a special wayBe sure to check them out, they have a sub and twitter[https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondTitties/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondTitties/)<https://twitter.com/Diamond_Titties>

the Finra report of 02-09-2021:<http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0>

Do take this with a grain of salt, there are methods on how this may not be reliable data as we have not seen enough shares sold to actually go from 220 to 78Also Finra is known to normally release early, but today was a first that they released late, the website even crashed when it was supposed to upload at a certain time (can be something can be nothing).

Why it may not be accurate:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgkvq6/short_interest_might_be_more_than_78_crosspost/>

**Institutional Ownership:**Also while everyone is talking about the 78% short a lot of people have missed this one; institutional ownership is now at 208%.... you can't own something more than a 100 right?Thread with sources:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgl4q5/institutional_ownership_of_gme_at_20596/>

high short interest: GME is still on top regardless of numbers being skewed<https://www.highshortinterest.com/>

Gme top cross traded stock; <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lghwuv/hope_for_gme_holders_gme_is_the_top_crosstraded/>

Short sale restrictions for 02-10-2021;<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgjt24/shortsale_restricted_for_210/>

They couldve only covered 13%:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lglaks/they_only_covered_13_and_we_saw_a_huge_ramp_up_in/>

I'd also advise people to check out this guy on youtube and twitch as he is fairly centric on his views, not bull or bear but just a good center.DookieDimez

Some Very good Mathematics and DD:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lgofsu/its_always_darkest_just_before_the_dawn/>

One last thing:

I've seen people saying if it comes to 400 sell because that's what the highest was last time.Dont!Because if you look at WSB and other forums (before the new mods so may as well been deleted right now), everyone was saying that this was not the rocket, as the growth just halted due to brokers stopping everyone.We should be able to see a few K's worth of stock if it rockets.I've seen people with decent Maths and DD say it would be way over 1k so please, remember diamond hands are not important on just the way down, also on the way up.Try to find a good point where to jump ship, but try to time it right, as if everyone where to sell at 400 then that's it we would be killing our own momentum, but if we let it go up and up, the sky is the limit.

If anyone has any other useful things I might have missed please let me know I'll add those in as well!

Edit:\
Found this great mathematical work from a fellow user:\
