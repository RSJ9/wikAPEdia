Superstonk Live!

If you haven't yet, you need to [watch the AMA](https://youtu.be/fGVY2Kco8ng) with Dr. Susanne Trimbath that was streamed live on our new Non-Monetized Superstonk Live YouTube channel! I know I'm not the only one that felt like this was a turning point in the GME Saga; A pivotal time in this longer-than-anticipated journey on the GME rocket. Apes have finally found someone that knows the inner workings of the belly of the beast, and she confirmed that our suspicions were correct (tits=JACKED!) and that APES ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. I don't know about you, but after hearing her talk about fighting this corruption for almost 30 years, I saw a light in her eyes and a spark in her spirit that could only have been caused by 1 thing...

Apes!

Dr. T has been screaming at the walls of Wall Street about naked short selling and the need for reform for the last 30 years. Nobody cares. Not enough people understand. She says there are very few people in the world that have the capacity and the willingness to learn and understand this big of a picture. Can you believe it? Dr. T basically said even the smoothest brained apes are still among the smartest in the world!

Several members of the mod team have also been working on putting together a "DD" of sorts, of all the talking points from the AMA. We are doing everything we can to make sure this information is preserved and available to all apes around the world! Because without the support of every single ape in this jungle, none of this would be happening right now. It doesn't matter if you're a lurker with a single share, or a regular poster with 1,000, we are all members of this community that made this progress possible. Pat yourselves on the back, apes!!

I'm the pink one duh 🦄

Speaking of teams, I would really like you to meet your team that made this possible!

[u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/), [u/Luridess](https://www.reddit.com/u/Luridess/), [u/Leaglese](https://www.reddit.com/u/Leaglese/), and [u/Cuttingwater](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cuttingwater/) have all been working tirelessly on the back end, doing everything from transcribing the audio to creating the Summary DD. This is a labor of love and they are dedicated to making this information available to ape nation to share far and wide. Where is the gospel without a scribe?

[u/StonkU2](https://www.reddit.com/u/StonkU2/) was point person to actually speaking to Dr. T and arranging the AMA. This might not have come together if not for Stonk's help. He was pretty critical to making it happen. Don't let him tell you otherwise. (He will.)

[u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/) was our Chuck Todd. He did an *outstanding* job remaining composed, respectful, concise, engaging, and overall just made apes everywhere proud. Way to go Ato! 💪

[u/Redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/Redchessqueen99/) was our Producer. Some of you may have seen when the first link didn't work, and last minute she had to create a new link to then share with the (waiting) public. And that was done within *seconds.* I saw several remarks on the professional quality of the production as a whole. That's thanks to our fearless leader, Red. 💖💖

And of course all the other mods that work to keep Superstonk a fun place to hang out and talk bananas. This is the best corner of the internet thanks to the support from viewers like you! Thank you!

So since we're all hyped and hopeful and not gonna get anything done today anyways....

🚀🚀🚀TGIF LET'S SKIP WORK AND JUST GIVE AWAY FLAIRS TO CELEBRATE HOW AWESOME SUPERSTONK IS!!!!🚀🚀🚀
