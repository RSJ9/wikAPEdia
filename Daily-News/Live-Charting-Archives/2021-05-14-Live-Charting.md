Good Morning Superstonk!

Happy Friday!

I'm feeling pretty excited about today yesterday we closed up 13.96% as I told my wife's boyfriend that's almost 14%. I know, maths. I think everyone can breath a little easier today as of now GME is down only $318.5 from it's all time high! :)^^<!

On a more serious note, it appears they are now targeting retail with margin calls. This is pretty serious as another¬†[redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/nblsvz/why_am_i_getting_margin_called_for_250k/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)¬†showed they are not being very careful with these margin calls. It seems they are trying to throw retail under the bus, first, as they scramble to improve their own positions. These mistaken margin calls remind me of the events that occurred With Alex Kearns last year. No position is worth your life and debt can always be repaid.

Lastly as price action picks up today, I may walk away from the reddit post while managing positions, if this is the case you can find me on the stream and discord for a while longer at the links below.

Weekend Wrap-up

Thank you all so much for hanging out in here this week. Here are are closing stats for the day

[![r/Superstonk - Jerkin it with Gherkinit S1 E5 Live Charting for 5/14/21](https://preview.redd.it/j8lanwkw65z61.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=91390728e9b01d65795f646ff00501bc35e200cc)](https://preview.redd.it/j8lanwkw65z61.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=91390728e9b01d65795f646ff00501bc35e200cc)

This is the first time in awhile that we have closed a week above max pain so that was pretty exciting. I kind of thought we would fight for 162.5 all day while we consolidated after yesterdays upwards action. But we broke through the end of that wedge we are now currently forming a nice bull flag on the 4hr and I will have more information on why I'm bullish in my forward looking DD coming out this weekend on reddit and later on my YouTube (in video format). Thank you all again so much for the support and love. You guys have made these last 3 weeks so awesome.

Neither side winning going into power hour. 3.62 million Volume. Hopefully we'll see some action as the fight for max pain continues.

Edit 7 1:56

Finally something this weakness could pick up some steam as they attempt to drag us to max pain

Edit 6 12:48

Bounce at 160 probably retest 162.5 the volume is so dry

Edit 5 12:19

Failed to sustain support at 162.5 we could drop back to 157 although lack of volume indicates more chop

The battle continues...

Edit 2 10:18

Failed the test of 162.5 probably expect some short pressure to attempt to drive us below VWAP

Edit 1 9:45

Small dip at open it looks like today could be a battle of max pain and resistance at 162.5 a breakout to the upside above 162.5 would be good for us 700k. 160k shares borrowed to short.

Pre-market Analysis

Not a lot of price action in the after market we hit a high of 167 and now trading just below 162.5. I suspect shorts will attempt to push us below that towards max pain @ 155

After hours 5/13-14

We broke to the upside of the wedge yesterday in the exact time window I predicted on Wednesday :)

Big ol' Pennant

Let hope that volume and volatility continue to work in our favor today as bottom and top Bollinger bands are now in the Keltner Channels and TTM is ready to go boom!

Lastly MACD looks like it's about to have a nice crossover to the upside today as long as trends continue upward
