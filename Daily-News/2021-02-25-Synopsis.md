Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time.

*insert flashy intro card*

Short interest

Just like most women when dating me, lets talk about the short interest.

As Finra reportsÂ [here](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0)Â the current SI is 60% on GME itself.

Now here is where the trickery sets in, we know for fact that 60% is still huge right? I mean the VW squeeze in 2008 was only 18% so this is a lot more, but none the less 60% is a lot less than I expected.

And guess what... I can't find any data on the SI on the ETF's, and there are 63 ETFs that have GME in it.

So I've received some messages about people worrying, and I only have one answer to that.

DONT!

We knew some fuckery would happen, so this was most likely part of their plan, make info hard to get and go from there, so I'm actually ok with it because I'm sure there is a smart Ape in here that does know how to how to check ETF SI and I'll include it here.

Right now the minimum is 60% this means it can be a lot bigger!

Edit before posting:

one of our smart apesÂ [u/nov81](https://www.reddit.com/user/nov81/)Â posted these numbers and they sound credible, New SI: 60.35 % Old SI: 78.46% Float: 69.75 mil

Institutional ownership is currently at 156.76%:

you can check out his thread explaining this in a little bit more detail and his sourcesÂ [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls25hz/this_was_instantly_removed_on_wsb_dont_know_why/)

Also XRT IS SHORTED AT 193.65%Â Â

IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING??

Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently undergoing some routine checks.

Please be sure to put on your space suits, lift up your tray tables and no more walking down the aisles.

Yesterday was an amazing day, we started in the low 40's and in the aftermarket shot up to $190. Let that sink in for a second, in less than an hour we went over 200% then an hour or so later we where up 475%.

This is nothing short of amazing.

Be sure to compare it to last month when this happened it started the rocket for sure! and like we all promised to our $200/300/400 brothers, we would be back for you, so get ready cause we are coming!

Rocket go BRR?

Yes because stonks only go up.

But remember who we are up against, these guys have enough money to move entire markets, they're not called "market Makers" for nothing. these assholes will try EVERYTHING to get us to sell low.

so can this be a micro squeeze so they can say "look this is all that was left" ? YES

Can they try and fuck us over and halt trading at $480 last time? YES

Will we believe them? NO!

We have them in multiple interviews and when talking to the house committee saying "if we didn't halt it this would've gone in the thousands".

Not singular, PLURAL!

For this I need to urge the community something important

$1000 IS NOT THE GOAL, IT IS A CHECKPOINT!

see it as grinding for an achievement, it's a status bar filling, nothing more.

See it as the end of Halo Reach, this is a battle of how long everyone can hold their ground.

SO HOLD YOU DAMN DIRTY APES!

WE DON'T BREAK EVEN, WE BREAK THEIR WALLETS!

The king has spoken

And it seems that he is vibing to the tune of GME

[![r/GME - Synopsis for 02-25-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/0zwnf1hcblj61.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2b77ee82eab2667bb10644ba25db349a9f992e6)](https://preview.redd.it/0zwnf1hcblj61.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2b77ee82eab2667bb10644ba25db349a9f992e6)

The CFO stepping down.

Now I posted about this guy yesterday as well so why the hell would I mention him once more?I appreciate the question, and I'm thankful to answer that question here.

This guy was not a little boy from Bulgaria but he is a literal crayon eating moron.

Yesterday I hypothesized that him getting fired may be a good thing, he didn't adapt in the slightest in the past years, failed to rebuy stocks and basically I'm amazed this idiot came as far as he has.

It seems that this man is totally inept, and the more I read the more I come to believe he hasn't resigned but was pushed out of his role.

because guess what ?

This idiot used to have a position at "Coldwater creek" $CWTR after the crash of 2008 the company wasn't in a good position as it sells expensive adult female (40+) clothes, and guess what in a huge ass recession that aint a smart play. and this idiot didn't do anything a CFO needed to do in the next 4 years which lead to the company being sold off and rebranded and he got a fat severance cheque to go along with it.

```
From 2009 to July 2012 ColdWater did nothing but see RED and losing money, business was tanking due to "poor management".
In 2012 Coldwater had to borrow $65million from Golden Gate Capital.
GGC is a private equity firm run by a guy named David Dominik.
The deal was assisted by a recovering Hedge Fund company at the time 'Citadel LLC' Oh and guess who graduated from Harvard with David Dominik? Kenneth Griffin.

```

Now isn't that interesting?

Then this moron moved to PF CHANGS from 2016 to 2019 and again did the same thing, ran it into the ground and the entire company got sold off for 700 million in total, giving the board a nice little cheque as a severance. And this seems his usual MO, I'm sure if we look at the companies Mr. Bell (end) has worked for we can find some Citadel links with shorting or something, the later part is purely speculative but I'm sure we'll find a lot.

And after that he moved onto GameStop, and GME started another death spiral like PF Changs and CWTR did, only our boy Cohen stepped in.

Now why is this so important? got resolved right?

Nope, this may be the beginning of a big change, as this nimrod couldn't get on board with Cohens new vision of digitalizing the market and moving in a new direction. he was supposed to step down next month but it seems he is no longer on active duty and according to LinkedIn Jajeh has already stepped up in the position to safeguard the companies future.

[![r/GME - Synopsis for 02-25-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/tpjb1acvelj61.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1c2106453178192eaeb939a93a2ed02a7c3f41c)](https://preview.redd.it/tpjb1acvelj61.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1c2106453178192eaeb939a93a2ed02a7c3f41c)

he was also brought on board by the current CEO George Sherman, the same guy who ran the Autoparts store, home depot and Target in the mid 90's. a man who is so old-school he wouldn't know a digitalization from a Texas instruments calculator.

So this could be one of the first signs of Cohen making a move to becoming the new CEO.

What can we expect today?

[![r/GME - Synopsis for 02-25-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/2ignr2u5glj61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d5507027fa71c7a3107bbd078d96ff84e0c86fd)](https://preview.redd.it/2ignr2u5glj61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d5507027fa71c7a3107bbd078d96ff84e0c86fd)

fuckery, lots of fuckery.

Remember we are hitting them where it hurts, their money.

something to keep mind of is this:Â <https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls0wmd/if_gamestop_hits_800_before_226_we_will_trigger/>

*yes I know WSB has been unreliable at times, but I believe this retard may be right*

The thing we are looking for is the "cascade effect" it's like a domino effect, but it keeps triggering, just like one SJW gets triggered, this will trigger someone else and keeps snowballing.

Same thing is with automatic contracts on the stock exchange, there are calls and options on the field, and we need to get those. Because if we do they get fucked by Tyrone, and they can't do shit about it.

meet Tyrone

Also a good read:Â <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrvvh8/what_happened_today_why_and_what_might_happen/>

Just remember guys, get ready, be sure to have your every step planned, and don't sell low, remember what these bastards put everyone through all these years, the Dot Com crash, the housing crash, fuck they screwed the USA economy so fucking hard that it forced a recession on the entire world in 2008.

Not to mention they have condescended from their ivory towers the past weeks, called us dumb money, called us idiots and fucking morons.

Don't give them an inch, Leave nothing, these guys have had padded lives and never faced hardships like most of us,Â *it's about time they learned the price of a mile.*

As always this is not financial advice I need supervision when using scissors.

As always if you feel like I missed something feel free to mention it and I'll include it right here and I'll add it in!

a smart ape found the hidden meaning in thisÂ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lryuig/i_figured_it_out_heres_what_the_ryan_cohen_soft/)

The frog is seen as a figure of change, from a tadpole to a full frog, and even from male to female and back.

Chewy'sÂ first official board meetingÂ included two slides, a lot of laughter and a trip to McDonalds for soft serve.

Edit 4:

WE HAVE FOUND THE FUCKERY WE EXPECTED!

our wrinkle brained ape friendÂ [u/HeyItsPixeL](https://www.reddit.com/user/HeyItsPixeL/)Â just found out something amazing.

the fuckery!

Ok so little backstory, GameStop Stock is inside 63 different ETF'sThey are shorting ALL OF THEM!

this means they are digging their holes deeper and think they can outlast us.

go upvote his original threadÂ [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls830a/found_the_reason_for_the_dip_they_are_shorting/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

I'll copy it for exposure here as well!

Reason for the dip

EDIT (9:51AM): THEY ARE SHORTING $GME VIA 63(!) DIFFERENT ETFS

EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY! (<https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme>;Â <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME>)

EDIT 3: I actually predicted this in my post from yesterday (Â <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrijdv/my_theory_for_todays_market_close_get_ready_for_a/>Â ) Take a look at Edit4.

THE BIGGEST ONES:

ETF 1:Â <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/VIOV>Â - 20,000 SHARES SOLD SHORT

ETF 2:Â <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RWJ>Â - 4,500 SHARES SOLD SHORT

ETF 3:Â <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT>Â -Â 450,000Â SHARES SOLD SHORT

ETF 4:Â <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/VIOG>Â - 6,000 SHARES SOLD SHORT

ETF 5:Â <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IJR>Â -Â 350,000Â SHARES SOLD SHORT (Thanks to u/Â [JoeCitizen1984](https://www.reddit.com/user/JoeCitizen1984)Â for the find!)

-   DFAU

Also:Â They borrowed 1,500,000Â $GME SharesÂ to short yesterday (<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME>), but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs.

TL;DR: Millions of shares being sold short today, trying to get people to panic sell. DATA IS FROM 9:45AM AND I AM TRYING TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE.

Edit 5:

Wrinkle brainedÂ [u/Ren3666](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ren3666/)Â found this awesome thing!\
All available shorts for GME are gone, these idiots bought them all!

For the people thinking, Yes this is great news, these idiots literally dug their own hole deeper
