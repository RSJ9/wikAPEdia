Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

Intro

Due to what we've seen occur over the past weekend we are expecting a big influx of new members. I've seen threads from¬†[r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)¬†and other subs finally catching on that the behavior we have seen recently is far from normal.

For the people who are not familiar with the situation it's fairly easy:

Market makers/brokers/ idiots involved with stocks have abused crypto's in order to stave off their margin calls, they did this by pumping up lots of low cap crypto's so they could show they had enough liquidity they would dump it, in order to have profit to redo their work again and again.

Effectively digging their own hole deeper and deeper.

So for the new apes joining, welcome to the jungle!

Also because some people did not read it, there have been some updates to the sub a few days ago¬†[u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/)¬†wrote up a thread about it and be sure to give it a quick look to make sure you're up to date.

WO IST MEIN DEUTSCHE MARKT?!!

For everyone wondering WHY IS THERE NO GERMAN PREMARKET!!!???

it's due to Pentacost, it's a christian holiday so the german market is closed today, so expect the pre market volume to be even lower than normal.

Today is the day.... again.... part 10

So let's look at a couple of indicators

this was one of the indicators Dr. Burry used

Just to go off of indicators... this looks like a huge market crash is coming very soon, not "Blizzard soon tm" but actually soon.

We have seen a lot of new rules get passed very fast recently, we have seen banks and hedgefunds burning the midnight oil and on weekends, we see every possible indicator possible pointing to a market crash (even crypto is being cashed out because they need money)... this is the stuff hypothesized would happen for a long time, and now it's here.

To the Crypto gang just joining us, welcome, if you guys need help feel free to help in the daily thread, apes like to help with anything üòâ

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
