Now lets look at some other info to feed a tinfoil bias, first of all minehut is owned by SLGG.

written by¬†[u/FloTonix](https://www.reddit.com/u/FloTonix/)¬†and¬†[u/flyingwolf](https://www.reddit.com/u/flyingwolf/)

> After traveling 240,000 miles in 76 hours, Apollo 11 entered into a lunar orbit on July 19. The next day, at 1:46 p.m., the lunar module Eagle, manned by Armstrong and Aldrin, separated from the command module, where Collins remained. Two hours later, the Eagle began its descent to the lunar surface, and at¬†4:17¬†p.m. the craft touched down on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong immediately radioed to Mission Control in Houston, Texas, a now-famous message: "The Eagle has landed."

Again it's tinfoil at best but still interesting to speculate about.

Finra needs your input.

Now we're normally against commenting on mass, or even telling the sub "go quickly bla bla bla".

But here is the thing, this lady from Finra is asking the Apes directly, so be sure to leave them your opinion as this wont affect any of the rules in writing but could help create new ones.

But for the love of god please be respectful, shit flinging never helped anyone ;)

I have no further information on this lawsuit but did think it was interesting to share.

It's dangerous to go outside alone, take this!

[u/onlyfuturehuman](https://www.reddit.com/u/onlyfuturehuman/)¬†did something amazing, he backed up almost every DD in single consolidated pdf, this is seriously super impressive and I'm thankful he did this, be sure to give his thread a quick read and save the PDF in case of a reddit blackout!

OBV action

Would be a shame if someone could see the sideways OBV, seeing no major selling is happening right?

You get a Crypto, I get a Crypto WTF IS A CRYPTO!?

Like most of you I think "magic internet money" whenever I hear crypto, I'm not sure what it does or how it functions other than you can mine it and use it to pay for stuff.

Thank god our internal jellyfish¬†[u/Dismal-Jellyfish](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dismal-Jellyfish/)¬†wrote a DD about whatsup with the crypto stuff

It's enough to at least start thinking about crypto and what we could expect from it.

Ready, Get set... Ladder attack

So I've seen some newer apes complain about the opening and get demoralized, first of all welcome to the club buddies!\
This stuff is fairly normal, on most days you'll see the first hour or so get the price hammered down without any real reason.\
Good news, down, bad news, down, no news, down, Electing Ryan cohen to the Director of the board, believe it or not down.\
And to give you some proof that it's not just my opinion but something that happens consistently you can check out the following thread by¬†[u/FreezYourMind](https://www.reddit.com/u/FreezYourMind/)¬†:

LEGOOO

ok so lets end this on a happy note,¬†[u/the_end_is_neigh-_-](https://www.reddit.com/u/the_end_is_neigh-_-/)¬†made a super sweet concept in this thread

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Spielstopp/comments/oerfy9/gamestop_laden_f%C3%BCr_lego_ideas/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>

He made a lego set and trying to get it approved by lego and has a signiture thing going on here:\
<https://ideas.lego.com/projects/906f72e1-46fd-4228-b364-a3fbb7cea249>

I guess loads of people really still like lego, so I thought why not share.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
