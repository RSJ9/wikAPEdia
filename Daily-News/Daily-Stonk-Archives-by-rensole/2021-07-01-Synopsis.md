Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

It's up to 991 billion, but it was expected to be higher yesterday due to it being quarters end.

Some people have speculated a few things about this quarters end, we've been seeing banks double their dividends, this could be due to banks bolstering appearance like they did in 08, it could also be because of inflation hitting them and due to the value of the dollar may be lower therefore you need a bigger dividend.

Lots of speculation right now on that aspect but it won't be clear until we look at it with hindsight.

but having that said:

Volume is dryer now then a nuns habit.

Trading 212

Now since the last few days we've seen some things regarding t212 and their share lending stuff.

It seems they have two different type of accounts namely "ISA" and "investing"

With Isa your shares are not lended, and you can transfer and everything

With Investing it seems that your shares are going to be lended and they've always been as this is part of their terms and agreements, they're just making sure that everyone is informed and their EULA has to be reaccepted.

but I did find one screenshot on the sub that may be to use to some.

I'm not sure if this is possible because I myself don't have a t212 account but if you have another broker you could perhaps initiate a transfer to them, just like when people did this with Robinghood.

Robinghood

I've reported on this yesterday and I believe a lot of others are as well, the thing that people do need to remember is that this is not because of GME, this was a case that was ongoing from 2016 onwards, as robinhood was misleading it's client's.

Again this was just another "robinhood did a shitty job" and not "this was because gme".

RC Tweeted once again

This is a fairly common turn of phrase, meaning to either construct or deconstruct something piece by piece.

This could be meant as in:They are building GME back up from scratch, brick by brick

They are demolishing their opponents Brick by brick

or

They're building a new Crypto/nft system brick by brick

at this point it's unknown but sure as hell is fun to speculate over

I asked my Brick but he didn't make no sense

Or who knows, perhaps RC want's to become a bricklayer, who knows anymore at this point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
