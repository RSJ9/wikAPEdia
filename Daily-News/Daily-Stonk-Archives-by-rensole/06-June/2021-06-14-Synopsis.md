Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

Good Morning Everyone!

I hope everyone has had a great weekend, Are you guys enjoying e3 as much as I do ?

First let me start with something simple, because MSM has been reaching out to people for interviews and such.

We are not a collective, the term WE here is used as the "royal we", I just like the stock and others just happen to like the same stock. We also don't do politics, religion or anything else as all these things don't matter here, we just like the stock that's it. therefore there are no leaders or spokespersons.

The mod team has declined doing interviews at multiple occasions and will continue to do so until this is over.

the Reverse Repo's are looks to be related to GME

wrinklebrain¬†[u/jaybaumyo](https://www.reddit.com/u/jaybaumyo/)¬†wrote a thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nyqnqh/so_the_reverse_repos_are_definitely_related_to_gme/)

It shows how the reverse repo's seem to have a correlation between GME and the height of the repo's.

I've not personally had the chance to fully check this or see in how far the correlation goes, I do however remember that there was a rule change where bigger guys (SHF banks etc) could no longer use "junk bonds" as collateral, so this is why we might see an increase in the Reverse Repo, or maybe not, if you know more about this feel free to jump in that thread and help find out what's going on.

The reverse Repo's have another all time high, 547 billion... damn kenny that's actually impressive.

There have also been some other threads made finding some sort of correlation between reverse repo's/crypto's/GME

which you can find¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nz0fsz/i_found_a_correlation_in_why_reverse_repo_rates/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

What is driving the t+21 cycles?

[u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/)¬†made a big thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ny2ov4/a_revisit_to_net_capital_what_is_truly_driving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it goes into the t+21 cycle, what drives it how the ETF's fall into place with it etc.

I feel like giving work like this a TLDR version but eum.... brrrrr

Also there is a theory that this is what RC has figured out as well or at least thats what¬†[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nycuk4/cohen_has_reached_the_same_conclusion_as_ucriands/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)¬†goes over

Voting

There is a thread going on¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwv7vb/possible_evidence_of_manipulation_of_the_vote/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)¬†which goes into the difference of the voting we have seen this year in comparison to 2020, it shows that the 2020 was consistent, yet 2021 is not...

Again I know you can't see the total amount of votes on an 8k and with the current SEC probe we wont hear the actual numbers for a while so we'll just have to refer to the ol' reliable

Also¬†[u/gr8sking](https://www.reddit.com/u/gr8sking/)¬†did some quick maths

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-14-2021](https://preview.redd.it/ijo10g9y57571.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b4abbad108e1bc832b3bd2f763ee6af71e9894e)](https://preview.redd.it/ijo10g9y57571.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b4abbad108e1bc832b3bd2f763ee6af71e9894e)

just something to keep in mind üòâ

Also if you're new be sure to give¬†[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ny8mk8/the_infinity_squeeze_thesis_summary_and_breakdown/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)¬†a read, it goes over the basics and can help the new apes understand everything a bit better.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
