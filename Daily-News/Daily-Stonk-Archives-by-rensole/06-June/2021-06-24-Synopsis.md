Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

And another ATH reverse repo

at this rate we'll see 1 trillion before end of week.

The exponential floor by¬†[u/jth1](https://www.reddit.com/u/jth1/)¬†as he stated "Floor Guy's Log, Stonkdate 266. Still waiting to see a new pattern forming. Keeping on trucking" there was a theory on it being delayed another 18 days due to the ATM share offering but it's to early to make any statement or see a new pattern emerging.

RC tweeted again

this is from the episode "Behind the blow"

just before this scene stan complains about it being another rerun, this can be in reference to the market doing the exact same thing now as we've seen before, the hedgies doing something again like usual or.... T+21 because his tweets are spaced 21 days apart.

That spacing of 21 days is.. interesting but not conclusive of anything, but interesting nonetheless.

The water temple is hard as balls in OOT and a gamers test of patience, may be referring that, or the market being "under water" or could just be a coincidence for all we know.

002

Today is the day!

Today the 002 is going into effect, again...

This wont mean it gets implemented this morning or the afternoon it could even be in the AH

as Mac loves to say "today could be the best day in our lives, or just another regular day"

Margin Breach

<https://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance>

Specifically, CPMI IOSCO Quantitative Disclosure Results 2021 Q1:

<https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/policy-and-compliance/CPMI_IOSCO_Quantitative_Disclosure_Results_2021_Q1_1.pdf>

On page six, they have hte following statement about the NSCC margin breach:

> National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)At the end of the first quarter of 2021, NSCC's 12-month backtesting coverage level was 99.7%, with the 1-month coverage ratio for January at 98.8%, 99.9% forFebruary, and 99.5% for March. The median backtesting deficiency for the quarter was $3.3 million, which included a maximum backtesting deficiency incurred onJanuary 22, 2021, for¬†$1.06 billion.¬†*The largest deficiency incurred during the quarter was mainly driven by a single security exhibiting idiosyncratic risk*

I just wonder what "single security" caused that risk ü§î

Also what people should know there is a big difference between a "margin call" and a "margin breach", no one got margin called about GME up to now.

Citadel is not suing

Yesterday¬†[u/broccaaa](https://www.reddit.com/u/broccaaa/)¬†posted a thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o6cgkt/citadel_makes_formal_complaint_about_the_lucy/)¬†(now deleted)

there was a problem about lucy being sued or not, well lets add clarity to it

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-24-2021](https://preview.redd.it/chzv5ynwr5771.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f29c04d3555fcba8ec512dfe8901d21be4b32b1)](https://preview.redd.it/chzv5ynwr5771.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f29c04d3555fcba8ec512dfe8901d21be4b32b1)

they didn't sue her,¬†[u/broccaaa](https://www.reddit.com/u/broccaaa/)¬†didn't mean to spread BS/fud but it was a unfortunate phrasing on his part, but the gist of it stays the same, he was right Citadel did complain, this means they are paying attention.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
