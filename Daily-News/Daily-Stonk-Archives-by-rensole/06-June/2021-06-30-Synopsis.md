Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

Logarithmic floor guy¬†[u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/)

He is switching to weekly until something happens, so that could be today tomorrow or next week, who knows.

What I do like however is that¬†[u/ajquick](https://www.reddit.com/u/ajquick/)¬†also has adapted the model to fit the current flow, as you can see the exponential floor how it would go without the first share offering, with the offering and how it may be going now. Remember that there isn't a lot of data to calculate the current situation so it may be a little off or need to adjust the calculation, but I like how the previous two do line up and lets hope this means the current one will line up.

You can check his thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7eekh/recalculating_the_exponential_floor_equation_part/)

or better yet perhaps the two of them can work together on this.

If you would like to know about the person¬†[u/love_butter69](https://www.reddit.com/u/love_butter69/)¬†was kind enough to make an entire thread on him¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oaip1a/gurbir_grewal_attonery_general_nj_as_the_new/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Also an interesting one was Hanks FTD cycle on what is happening, and why it may have not been happening in the past week, it's interesting to read regardless\

But as to wrap up I'd want to go over two last things

Imagine being the magician, and you have 500K apes screaming out your tricks, that's whatsup.

Also I've seen people talk about Trading212.

Again this was a showerthought of mine, but instead of fudding around, just opt out of the share lending part if you don't want to be a part of that, and keep your shares in there?\
if you are going to hold anyway it doesn't matter if it's close only right?

I may not have a big wrinklebrain on this but perhaps this could help

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
