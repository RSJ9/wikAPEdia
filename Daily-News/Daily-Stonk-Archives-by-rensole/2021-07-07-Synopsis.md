The GameStop Discord

Gamestop launched their own Discord yesterday, and I've seen some issues surrounding that, but I just want to reiterate.

GameStop's Discord is for gamers, not stock investors.

Please let the discord be about gaming alone, otherwise they'd most likely close their discord and I feel like creating a Gamestop discord is a step in the right direction imo.

NFT stuff

Again some people don't understand what the hell nft's and crypto's do, I am one of those people, for me it's like magic internet money. but there is an entire thread¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of20ou/a_deep_dive_into_nftgamestopcom/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Gamestop will announce their own crypto and how to get it, don't trust random coins on the web, trust GME to inform us around the 14th or so, don't trust rando coins.

Magic beardy man is surprised

The Reserve Bank of Australia announced today that it would taper its Quantitative Easing.

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 07-07-2021](https://preview.redd.it/lbmuqvtjir971.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87598972f9d61971b2bddf44104e75d66b4da49)](https://preview.redd.it/lbmuqvtjir971.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87598972f9d61971b2bddf44104e75d66b4da49)

The Reserve Bank of Australia announced today that it would taper its Quantitative Easing (central bank purchases securities from the market in order to increase the money supply), by reducing weekly purchases of government bonds by A$1 billion a week, to A$4 billion a week.

as¬†[u/Dismal-Jellyfish](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dismal-Jellyfish/)¬†wrote:

The Bank of England¬†[announced in May](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2021/may-2021)¬†that it would reduce QE, winding down the bond purchases from ¬£4.4 billion a week to ¬£3.4 billion a week.

The Bank of England denied that it is reducing QE, calling it an "operational decision" that "should not be interpreted as a change in the stance of monetary policy."

The reason this does not count,¬†[according to BoE governor Andrew Bailey at the post-meeting press conference](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210506583/bailey-says-reduction-in-bank-of-england-bond-purchases-isnt-tapering-markets-seem-to-agree), is that the BoE didn't change its "fixed amounts" of its overall QE target of ¬£895 billion, it's just buying less per week to get to this target.

Seems like they are bracing for inflation, there may be more banks out there taking action right now but we may have overlooked

Unlocked Institutional Holdings per 13F/NPORT filings Update: 7/6/21 (Source:¬†[Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/))

It seems to me that this shows that institutional holders have... 39 million shares.

this feeds my bias so fucking hard.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
