NY Fed just released the latest number at 1:16pm ET: $432.9B. Shocked Pikachu, it's higher! It is almost exactly tracking the curve I plotted yesterday. I played with a few other function types and the closest match is still a polynomial, but now an order 2 with R-squared of 0.918, up from 0.885 yesterday.

Still looking to hit $500B by week's end. HOWEVER, according to other DD, reverse repo is not limited at that number, but individual participants are limited to $80B of Treasury borrowing per night, so if there are a few banks that are being big hogs at the trough, they may hit that limit soon.

One more thing (doing my best Columbo impersonation): there have been local dips in this number every Monday: 5/10, 5/17, 5/24. No idea why that would happen except maybe reverse repo peaks mid-week? In any event, it might hit $500B before Friday if this week is like the last two.
