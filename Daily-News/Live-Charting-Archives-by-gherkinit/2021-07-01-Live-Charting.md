Today might be an interesting one yesterday I think we saw some liquidity tests on the stock these are generally done to see how much a given set of capital will move the price so 40k shares to go up $4 and 160k to go back down again.

Pre-Market Analysis

Absolutely dead this is the lowest pre-market volume I have ever seen on GME we will see if it picks up before opening bell. $400k Shares available to borrow.
