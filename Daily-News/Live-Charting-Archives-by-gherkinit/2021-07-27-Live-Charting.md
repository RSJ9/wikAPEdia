Good Morning Apes!

Here I am getting ready for another record breaking day!

Let's see how much the MMs push us up today on historic low volume. Last week we went from $174 to around 195. This week we are starting around 183, so at least a test of 200? The illiquidity is really starting to test their hand, as bid ask spread was approaching $4 dollars yesterday. I wouldn't be surprised if we gap up.

After-Market

Definitely not the day I expected, setting a new low volume record and 200k shares mysteriously appeared before that last run-up. I guess not a significant amount of those ITM puts were closed on Friday. The ones that are currently coming in are for later dates so it could be those contracts remain open. Indicators are still pointing up but at increasing levels of low liquidity it seems like nothing is gonna happen till volume picks up and when it does the spread will be so wide we may move up very quickly. Thank you all for tuning in and sorry for delays in updates due to outages.

Volume coming in pretty hard with the market turnaround. Still waiting for MM to come and buy the stock almost 1/4 of our daily volume in the last 20 minutes

A bunch of ITM puts rolled in when we tested 180. hard to say if we had enough volume to push through anyway.

Inverse head and shoulders...sort of. Volume this low makes intraday TA kind of messy but looks like we could see a run up. Interesting note at :40 past each hour we have gone up today just noticed. Probably doesn't mean anything, but the fuckery is definitely more apparent on such low volume. Approaching 700k now.

Nice bounce into an uptrend at 178 last week it looks like MMs bought in around 1:40

Pre-Market Analysis

Chopping along the test of 185 all night and into the pre-market. The volume currently is non-existent around 6k shares traded so far with 25k shares to borrow. They will have to raise the price at some point to create sellers you know ,supply and demand, or give up on their 6 month campaign of price suppression either way one step closer to MOASS.

Here is our current progress on the long-term technical analysis, as you can see trading right along our lower support. MACD crossed over yesterday and based on the bid ask spread volatility is definitely coming.

Ascending Triangle on the 1D

TTM squeeze looks like it's about to flip to the upside as well today
