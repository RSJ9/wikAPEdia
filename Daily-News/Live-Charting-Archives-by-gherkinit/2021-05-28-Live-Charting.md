Good Morning Apes!

250 apes we have arrived currently we have another 4,991 options ITM with another 1868 at 260 dollars. But get ready for today even though I doubt they effectively pull off attacks in the manner they have in the past, don't think they won't try. I expect the price to go up but I also expect untold levels of f*ckery be prepared. I'll say it again "Diamond hands are forged under pressure", it's gonna be a wild ride either way.

*As price action picks up today, I may walk away from the reddit post while managing positions, if this is the case you can find me on the stream and discord for a while longer at the links below.*

After-Market Wrap up

Down 12.82% on the day still up $50 this week. I thought we could go as low as $215 today so I'm glad that the 220 wall was ultimately held I think we will see the uptrend continue on Monday that I will cover in this weekends forward looking TA. Thank you all for the support and interest this week. I hope you guys have a great three day weekend and I will see you all Tuesday morning at 9am EST.

Weird little battle for SSR or 230c I'm not sure although with the bid/ask spread it could be advantageous for Tuesday to trigger SSR

Still sideways below 240 they are holding 140 to keep those options out of the money and prevent gamma ramping. Let's see If bull side wants to push back or just collect profits and do stuff next week.

Edit 8 1:35

Chop volume is a bit dead . I still think we'll see one last push from bull side to get those 250c ITM

Looking to test 250 soon and get those apes/options back ITM

Edit 3 10:34

Seems like a confirmed bounce @ 240. Remember all they can buy is time and their only tools are boredom and fear. Ignore the short "attempts".

Edit 2 10:26

Supports are slipping but nothing to be worried about I said if we failed that support we could see some nice dip buy opportunities well here they are I'm looking at possibly 215 as the intraday low

Edit 1 9:45

Looking to hold 260 out of the gate a failure here could be a dip buy opportunity. 1.85M traded so far.

Pre-Market Analysis

GME hit a pre-market high of 266.50 and there are about 260,000 shares to borrow. It's looking like the gap up was filled the rocket is fueled and we are ready to go. Literally every indicator I can think of has begun firing. Let's do this. Apes need rescued and margins need called.
