Edit 20 2:06PM:

Aw man I had my popcorn and fries ready. Stock at 161.67 right now. Can the show start :) ?

Edit 19 2:02PM:

Significant buy volume >100k. Will it be sustained though?

Edit 18 2:00PM:

Big green candle. Show finally starting?

Edit 17 1:48PM:

------------>

Edit 16 1:12PM:

Volume picking up. Bit of an upside breakout/mean reversion.

Edit 15 12:25PM:

Well helloooo there Mr. Wedge. Volume too low as of now for a major breakout. If volume kicks back in, perhaps we can see an upside breakout.

Edit 13 11:59AM:

This particular line, resistance of the wedge is now acting as a support line. We could continue inching lower through the day.

Volume dried up, less than 10k a minute.

Edit 7 10:15AM:

152.5 support is next.

Edit 6 9:51AM:

We're moving below that channel right now, but we can end up spending a lot of time bouncing in that channel.

Premarket Analysis

Bit of a small skirmish premarket. GME gapped and was immediately shorted down.
