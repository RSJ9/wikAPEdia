Visualization of this weeks gamma ramp max pain at 185

So far it's been another week of HF fuckery but it looks like long funds and degenerate gamblers have set up quite the trap for the SHFs if they buy in as expected there are some rumors around 460k FTDs due today and the TA points to a hard bounce being possible. If we clear 200 we are shooting into the stratosphere. We may see some whales finally deploy some capital to achieve this today.

Edit 7 3:02

Starting power hour off sitting right at 180 waiting for a push to trigger the ramp into close tiny rejection but it looks like we will re-test

Edit 6 2:19

Watching the whale war go down is entertaining but 800k daily volume is disgusting

Edit 5 1:30

Failed the test drooped back down to VWAP bouncing a bit now.

Edit 4 12:30

Don't worry just testing 180 and some additional pickle manipulation

Edit 3 12:04

Failed the test at 178 bounced on VWAP and coming in to test again 12-2 is the best time for longs to deploy capital and gain full advantage of the ramp. So the next 2 hours could be interesting, although I don't expect much as our volume right now is 200k lower than yesterday at the same time

Edit 2 11:28

Crossing VWAP with a bit of volume coming in. To take full advantage of that ramp they will want to kick things off sooner rather than later

Edit 1 9:50 Dip then a failed test at 180. Calls still coming in.

Pre-Market Analysis

Currently sitting just at 180 I would expect if the gamma ramp was to be taken advantage of today there would be a decent push at market open. Volume currently around 10k with 300k shares all of a sudden available to be borrowed...

You can see there was a pretty strong push down yesterday

MACD is about to crossover still all week with the signal line tip touching, so far it's just been a big tease. Additionally, set up for a bounce on the weighted VWAP and a breakout to the next resistance zone.
