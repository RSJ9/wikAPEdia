Good Morning Superstonk,

I think the only thing for me to reasonably say here today is that nothing has changed, the shorts haven't covered, the company is definitely not going out of business and 5 million shares does not cover 56M+ Shares sold short. GME did beat earnings by 46% per share, we got a kick ass CEO/CFO team from amazon, and we are still gonna get listed to the Russel 1000.

We already won the game, we are just waiting for it to end to get our kick-ass trophies.
