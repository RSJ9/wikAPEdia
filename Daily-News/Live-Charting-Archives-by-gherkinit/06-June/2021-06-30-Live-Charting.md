Good Morning Superstonk

Another day another pickle related crayon session

We are kind of in a lull right now the TA for this week is still in bullish trend. As far as other catalysts not a lot I can think of in the near term. I heard -005 goes in to effect today but am having some difficulty find a source that is reliable.

Edit 7 3:03

These liquidity test would be to see how much a given amount of capital moves the price but these are usually done in a simulation. This is odd to say the least

Edit 5 1:46

And just like all consolidation on GME a nice break to the upside

Edit 3 11:20

Baby bulltrap possibly a liquidity test for a bigger move...hard to say as only a much larger following move could confirm it

Edit 2 11:00

Bounce on VWAP possible wedge on the intraday these are usually a bit unreliable as this one has very little supporting volume. Additionally vole is still <650k so probably not enough top move through resistance unless something comes in.

Edit 1 10:00

Down and then back up to resistance at 210 looks like a dull day based on volume so far although we inverted the SPY run up at open so that probably means some of those 300k shorts got dumped

Pre-Market

Pre-Market is pretty flat since close, 12k volume right now with 300k shares available to borrow. OI on calls is picking up a bit as we get closer to Friday and IV dips. Max pain this week is 212.50.

The SPY is still struggling to cross back into it's long term trend.

Spy 1D timescale

Lastly still looking good on that cup & handle actually looks like we may see a small bit of upside today
