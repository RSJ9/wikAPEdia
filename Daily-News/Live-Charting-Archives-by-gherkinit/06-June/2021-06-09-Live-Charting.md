Good Morning Superstonk!

I wanted to make sure everyone knew, before anything else

"I might be early, but I'm not wrong"

Now that my ego is assuaged "let's get down to business, to defeat some funds"

After Hour Wrap Up

Closed the day slightly above 300 keeping the 300c ITM for now. I expect some volatility post earnings but nothing too dramatic let's see how after hours play out. I'll post my synopsis here on tomorrow morning's post. Thank you all again for tuning in and Happy 6/9.

Nice little run to start off power hour, looks like we might see more now that we are trading in the upper range I showed earlier

I'd say wait for a dip but there isn't enough volume for one

Edit 7 1:41

Breakdown from the daily trend the volume is super low since about 12:30 so that could have a lot to do with it

Edit 5 12:28

Thesis still the same, no news = good news, titz are still jacked! Double bottom to a test of 310 let's see if some volume comes in

Chopping above 313 right now. No verifiable news from the shareholder meeting about vote count as far as I have heard so far.

Edit 3 10:32

Bounced off 300 testing 310

Edit 1 9:53

Dip at open they will want to keep this under 300. I do not expect any price action till after the SH meeting.

Over here on the 4h timescale you can see the expect price action for the week based on this weeks DD. This is day 21 of this pattern playing out. If we break 350 resistance today I'm looking for another one of those deviations from the week before last to occur. Last time it was when we broke 242.50. Possible high 371 and a possible low of 246.50
