It's Monday LFG !

I'm actually more hopped up on today than I should be possible market corrections, Russel addition complete, all those dirty hedgies trying to get their hands on my favorite stock just makes pickle perk up!

Oh I'm better the doctor officially confirmed that titz were way to jacked so I bought some more GME during pre-market. Everything is a dip right?

Big buy walls just went up maybe we'll see a nice spike into close again

After Market Wrap

Closed up definitely not as exciting as I had hoped really thought we would see a little run up at close but I'll take 1.71%. Thank you again for hanging out see you tomorrow morning!

Still sideways dipped below VWAP on basically no volume no technical indicators of note

Edit 3 11:49

Got caught up talking about cheeses on stream, sorry. Nice bounce of mean headed back up to VWAP

Edit 2 10:15

Head and shoulders off that failed test could see our intra day low or at least a return to 210-11

Edit 1 9:46

Nice upward action continuing into a bounce off VWAP hopefully we can finally set that support at 225

Pre-Market Analysis

Pre-Market Volume around 45k, with 100k shares available to borrow, we had 6.07 shares traded Friday with almost no effect on the price I expected to see some relevant arbitrage but so far there is nothing to speak of. I will continue to monitor the CV_VWAP through the day if anything pops up you'll be the first to know. Small spike at open and now trading sideways. This mornings price action could really go either way but we had some good news so expect the standard psychological shorting at market open. GME has been picking up a bit of steam on the news cycle and social networks so a positive open today and maybe a run up to $225.2 at that support/resistance would help build the Bull case for this week.
