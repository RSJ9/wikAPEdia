Good Morning Apes!

Hello everyone and welcome to another Friday. I wanted to address something before jumping into the rest of the post today. These posts are done to give apes an idea of where the stock will go on a day to day basis, they are not done for the purposes of day-trading the stock. If you use them to day-trade the stock instead of doing your own TA and research, you're a fucking idiot...

There is a significant short position on the stock and the holders of that position will not hesitate, as the last few weeks have proved, to dump significant amounts of capital to suppress the breakouts ($3.7B in the last few weeks). They use Technical Analysis as well and are obviously aware of breakout timings. The purpose of this tactic is to generate fear in the asset, it is the same reason the stock get's shorted on every piece of good news to prevent FOMO from the general public. Every breakout shorted costs them money, reducing their burn rate on the position.

We are dealing with a cornered animal, there is no tactic to low or dirty for them to employ. Technical analysis simply shows us the opportunity points for bulls to move in, and if they attack those breakouts the strength of the SHFs capital reserves (based on the relative strength of the attack).

All someone needs to do to win is buy & hold.

It's actually that simple.

Thank you,

Anyway, we didn't drop to that lower trend which is good and some of the OI in calls got rolled for next weeks ramp. Thank you for tuning in and stay tuned for this weekends DD on Sunday.

Chopping along under VWAP head and shoulders might drag us back down to 158 again.

Edit 1 10:45

Sorry for the delay I had to manage positions. GME Chopping between resistance and support at 162.5 on 600k volume no major action in either direction so far.

Pre-Market Analysis

Currently sitting on 10k shares to borrow those 190k of the 200k available were borrowed between 7:00-7:15am. There is a possible gap fill back to $168 volume is around 10k however so price action at opening will be hard to predict. We can be moved significantly up on very low volume.

This is a quick look at where our long term TA stands currently. The bounce off the trendline Wednesday was shorted pretty hard as that combined with the positive news of S&P 400 inclusion could have been a small catalyst. Remember the SHFs need to keep the price below that Gamma ramp, so they are literally being squeezed downward right now. We have significant increase in retail liquidity at 162 as this is the lower range of the majority of apes cost average. I overlaid the price action from 4/21-5/17 to give a better idea of what happened before the last run up and expected range of movement. We are currently on the upper support trend we will either bounce or drop to the lower support @$150.
