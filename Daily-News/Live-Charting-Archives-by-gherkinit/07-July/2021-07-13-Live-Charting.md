Good Morning Superstonk,

GME has been smashing records the last couple days with how little volume it's been trading. Even on it's worst days it's winning...

The bullish sentiment leading into yesterday hasn't faded for me yet. All the indicators are the same, mostly because they really don't move much on zero volume. So get your titz jacckked we're going in again.

2.35 million down 5% super slow day interestingly though a shitload of call/put volume coming in all day looks like the whales are fighting their war of the delta hedge while we stare at the ticker. Very nice setup up coming in for Friday above $200 this week and we are gonna actually take off. So expect a protracted fight. Tomorrow could be interesting. Thank you all for tuning in.

$300k worth of ITM 200p came in to push the price down. but it looks like we are bouncing on 181.

Nice bullish bounce some other "meme" stocks are moving this morning usually a sign GME will move but usually it moves last. Nice bullish bounce into VWAP test.

Pre-Market Analysis

Could be heading into another pretty flat day or a possible climb on zero volume 190 has been holding really well as a low support there are about 150k shares currently available to borrow, normally this would be insignificant but with the volume around 10k, it could move the price more than we would like. Although, it does look a bit volatile this morning even with the low volume.

A little sideways yesterday after the bounce of the long-term trendline but still within range a little sideways and up would be an acceptable outcome for today to continue the trend. BBKC squeeze still looking ready to explode outward.
