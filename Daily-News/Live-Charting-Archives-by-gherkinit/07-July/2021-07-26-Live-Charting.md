Good Morning Apes!

Sometimes, you stay up till 4 in the morning trying to piece together t+2 MM cycles and trying to determine where they are strongest. Sometimes, that means you wake up at 9:10 when you should have been up at 7am and 300 people message you to find out if you alive...lol.

I am...just not caffeinated.

After Market

Couple test of 185 failed to stay over in close but action picked up a bit at the end of the day tomorrow could be interesting if we get a crazy low volume test of 200. Thank you all for tuning in I'll try to be on time tomorrow.

Edit 5 1:21

Crossed VWAP with some volume coming in possibly another test of 185

Edit 4 12:39

Double bottom on the 180 resistance. Doesn't mean anything if there is no volume on the follow-up

Edit 3 12:00

40k volume traded since the last update trend looks weak but there really isn't any volume to push it either way still floating around 182.5 but above 180 is positive

Edit 2 10:58

Choppy but better volume, looks like we might continue the uptrend now as we cross VWAP

Edit 1 9:56

And so we begin another low volume uptrend...where it will stop nobody knows. But probably around 185-190

Pre-Market Analysis?

Slightly up on 15k volume, 35k shares to borrow looks like the start of our day should be pretty slow. Some nonrelevant price action at market open. Todays ideal move would be a break-away of 180 possibly to 185 or even a test at 190.
