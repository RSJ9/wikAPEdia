I guess the runup could have been another liquidity test but volume still below 1M it's hard to tell. Currently coming back up to test VWAP.

Pre-Market Analysis

Around 150k shares available to borrow this morning, Volume is looking pretty low right now at around 8k but this could pick up closer to market open as I'm a bit early today. The SPY gapped down so we may get dragged this morning if it drops be prepared for a dip opportunity if you notice the SPY sagging and our volume remains low. We gapped down at pre-market open and have filled possible we test ~195 before open.

GME has had $13.3M of call side open interest near the money, come in in the last couple days. Even though max pain is being dragged down by those OTM puts call volume is pretty significant. I expect some people are very intent to set up a gamma ramp towards Friday, taking advantage of the currently very low IV.
