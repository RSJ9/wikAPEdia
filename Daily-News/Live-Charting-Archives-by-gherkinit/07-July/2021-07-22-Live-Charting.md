Good Morning !

Well yesterday was a bit interesting. I can't be sure what exactly is promoting the SHFs to dump so much capital into shorting the current bullish trend. With $780m in puts this week it appears they are trying even harder to suppress the price action than they were last week, except the effect seems to be more limited. We are still well within our expected trend for the week. This could be another case of letting GME run last as they profit from or cover other short positions on the market to inflate margin requirements. I'm still expecting a breakout to the upside as bulls continue to maneuver into a strong gamma ramp for Friday. If the price crosses 200 solidly, we should just rocket up. Right now we are sitting right on max pain.

Pre-Market Analysis

8:40am

Volume pretty low right now at 10K with 35k shares available to borrow. I expect we could gap up again this morning testing 190-195 again similar to yesterday.
