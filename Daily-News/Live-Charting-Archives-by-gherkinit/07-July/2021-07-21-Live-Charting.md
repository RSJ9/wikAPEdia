Good Morning Apes!

Well I hope your all ready for another day of sick gains on slightly better volume. Clearly GME is getting ready for a run If TA isn't your thing the circumstantial evidence abounds. All of a sudden 2-3 man hedge funds are short GME, Analyst Ratings are positive, and the MSM is giving slight hints that GME is not the worst investment possible.

It's always a good sign in a trade when the media shifts to your side of things, it means the other side is getting fucked and they are getting ready to say they were right all along. While we may not give a shit about the news, make no mistake their influence over boomer investors and actual "dumb" money is absolute.

TLDR; Slather yourself in some #BullMAYO and buckle up we are going for a ride.

After-Market

That day started nice and dropped off hard even at close the majority of our volume for the day was traded around 190. They are still shorting pretty hard through the options chain but it appears as if it's through ETF's and not so much on GME itself. I would imagine that options liquidity is drying up on GME for put side so they are resorting to other tactics. Still we did get that test of 195 today and the gamma ramp still looks strong especially above 200 so let's see if the bulls put there money where their calls are this week. Thank you all and see you tomorrow.

RIP at 2-2:15 I'm thinking

Edit 3 12:08

Boring flat midday, currently I expect some post-lunch action when the bulls come back a little sloppy with lower risk management

Head and shoulders reversion back to 190 looks like we are gonna bounce and hold the 190 support

Pre-Market

Looks like we have about 26k volume with 70k shares available to borrow. We had a quick run up to 195 then a push back down under 190. I expect a slight opening dip then up to test 190 before 12pm, sooner on a high volume open.

Here is the options data for the week so far about 2:1 call:put, so the bulls are just crushing it. I expect this action will continue through Friday.

GME Options bought near the ask for this week

Here is where we are on our weekly ascending triangle, our next resistance of note is at 225.20 with support below us at 180. MACD is very close to it's crossover on the daily and Stochastic RSI is moving up from oversold after the K/D crossover last week. (Bullish Momentum)
