Happy Friday Apes!

Woke up to a packed inbox this morning.

1.  Yes, I know he-who-must-not-be-named has crossed over to the meltdown side, it happens when you lose $1000s betting options on tweets...

2.  We spent 2 hours yesterday talking about Tropic Thunder on stream and Elon Tweeted about it.

Edit 2 10:31

Nice bounce probably covering the 200k shares borrowed this morning. Short hedge fund circle jerk right?... GME bounced nicely off VWAP hopefully continuing the uptrend

Edit 1 9:51

Looks like the borrowed shares got spent without a lot of price action but the volume remains pretty low right now. If it stays this way I expect sideways and down.

Pre-Market Analysis

Today looks interesting. Solid uptrend throughout pre-market, I would love to see an open test of 200. Volume currently sitting at about 10k so kind of low but when have we ever needed volume to go up? Looks like about 200k shares borrowed so possibly a small dip if volume stays low maybe a drop of $5.

GME pre-market 1m

We dropped from the cup and handle a little bit yesterday but since we've traded so little volume out of the formation it's very possible that the expected bounce is still likely. Also we got our first BBKC fire signal on the daily yesterday.
