Goood Morning Superstonk!

So unfortunately today I will have a power outage from around 10am - 2pm EDT (UTC-4) this is an estimate it may take a bit longer. I will be back and continue posting as soon as the power is back on I just wanted to let you guys know about the interruption. I may have the discord live audio going during that time if I can facilitate that.

After Market

Well we ended slightly up un the day but that movement was robbed about 15 seconds into after-market trading either way a green close is a green close. Sorry there wasn't a lot to say today after we tested 190 the fifth time we were pretty flat. Looks like some gamma from puts is dragging us down along with the overall market. Thank you all again for the support I'll see you bright and early tomorrow.

Nice bullflag popped us through 190 but buy pressure slacked off so instead of a another breakout we are just in an ascending channel. Looks bullish going into the afternoon however.

Good opportunity to break through 190 right now

Sideways under VWAP this is a good opportunity if bull side wants to break resistance. SPY chopping but still in a downtrend.

Pre-Market

400k shares were borrowed this morning at pre-market open so far 200k have been returned. We had a big gap down but pre-market volume is at the highest for this week (45k) we could see a bounce this morning but with the massive drop on the market it could be a red day. The market coming down like this is beneficial short term to the short positions as it drives interest elsewhere and it is easy to drop the price on low volume. Remember when fuckery is afoot hodl and enjoy the sale.

GME pre-market

The SPY is down 133 basis points in the pre-market today this is some not insignificant movement towards those corrections zones we discussed in the weekly. However this could bounce back quickly.
