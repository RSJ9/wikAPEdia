Good Morning Apes!

Here we are primed for yet another day of fun in the sun, Market Action. Possible passing of SR-NSCC-2021-801 today could be a catalyst. This essentially states if they deem member positions are to risky they can margin call them immediately, also changes reporting of these positions from a monthly to daily time frame. So that's nice.

We had a bit of a dip yesterday which presented few fantastic buying opportunities, as more apes panic bought. I still expect the floor of the stock to be 157 it should take more than a small concentrated effort to get us trading below that.

We went down, we went back up volume was exceedingly low.

Please bookmark the YouTube and Discord for future outages. Thank you all again for the support and I will see you bright and early tomorrow.

Gherkinit,

Absolutely sideways again but with a nice cushion on resistance

Edit 12 2:47

And we are back...I hope. $2 dollar upwards price move as apes panic bought due to comms being down? Still no volume but we are clear of the 157 support and trending towards 162.5.

Edit 11 1:43

Small buy-in shot us up above VWAP and back above that 157 resistance. Looks like we can hold above 157 for now. Maybe a re-test soon.

Edit 9 12:32

Moving up to re-test VWAP. I am hearing in chat that TD is listing GME as hard to borrow, and Schwab is not allowing market orders. Take this with a grain of salt but it is an interesting development.

Volume has completely dried up we are trending down but I expect it can drift back up soon

Nice little intraday bull pennant might break up but volume really died off.

Edit 5 10:20

Looks like we are winning the battle at 157. As long as the market keeps going up I expect we will as well.

Edit 4 10:03

Coming down more I think this is an effect of the market pressure the SPY is down $5 already and looking weak. Nice fire sale if we continue down.

Descending channel. I'm looking for this to break up as short side fights for 157 resistance.

250k volume in the first 5, 750k shares available to borrow, and looks like we are testing 157

Pre-market Analysis

Pre-Edit 1

Looks like VWAP gapped down as we traded on low volume between 160-166.

Here is CV VWAP for this morning there was some arbitrage on the dip yesterday but still sitting in the neutral band
