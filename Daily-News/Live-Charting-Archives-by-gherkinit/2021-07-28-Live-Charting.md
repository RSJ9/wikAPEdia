Good Morning Apes!

Well I suppose we are being added to the S&P 400. I think this will be a slightly net negative move due to the fact that we are the most heavily weighted company in the S&P 600. It could at least get some volume flowing.

I want to make a comment on $550m in shares being purchased for the move. Blackrock (ishares), Vanguard, and State Street (SPDR) already own GME in S&P 600 funds, while there are other mutual funds, pensions, etc... that track the index and it will bring more institutional interest in. The majority of ETF holders already own the shares. I do not imagine that it will play out much differently than the Russel 1000 inclusion.

I love confirming bias as much as the next guy, but let's stick to the facts. I want the stock to go up to but I don't think we need to be hinging the price action on events they don't ever meet expectations, and hurt morale. It's very simple the shorts [haven't covered](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp). When they do, we will go to the moon. Until then let's stay jackked to the titz, but skeptical.

After Market

The Massive short attack this morning both through shares and options additionally facilitated by the market's downtrend and early low volume actually drove some interest back into the stock. Hopefully we see volume picking up over the next couple days to close out the week . I think a retest of 180 is definitely in the cards for tomorrow. Thank you all for the support, see you bright and early tomorrow morning.

Climbed up for a bit but the volume has not returned retest of 170 probable.

Market downturn. H&S playing out should bounce on 170

Edit 3 12:15

Seems like we've established a nice uptrend, volume is actually ok today even though most of it has been on the short side GME is down very little.

Market got slammed on open and those 200k borrowed short look like they got used up you know standard dip on good news. Although it feels good to have some volume. Enjoy the dip.

Pre-Market Analysis

The 200k thousand shares that mysteriously appeared yesterday have disappeared just as quickly this morning at 7:15am. There was a weird after hours spike last night, possibly a liquidity test for S&P 400 inclusion. Volume in the pre-market is still complete crap, and since we only traded about a million shares yesterday none of the Technical Indicators have really changed.
