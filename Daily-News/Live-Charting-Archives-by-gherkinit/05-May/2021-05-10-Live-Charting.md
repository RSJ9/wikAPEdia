Good Morning Superstonk!

Another day of reading charts and drawing pretty pictures with me Gherkinit everyone's favorite financially inclined pickle. So big¬†[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n8qlbh/jerkin_it_with_gherkinit_forward_looking/)¬†yesterday...I will attempt to answer questions. For all those complaining about the lack of a TLDR the video DD will be out a couple hours after market close today.

IV is low AF, triangles are drawn, and titz are jacked so hard I can't buckle the seatbelt on this fucking rocket ship!

Lastly, almost all major brokers now have their proxy material available. If you own a company you should be making your opinion heard. Vote.

After Market Stuff

Here are our stats for the day I expect as we near the peak of the pennant their motivation will be to keep the price down. They borrowed 200,000 shares this morning and had the advantage of the market downtrend behind them, at least the volume was strong. Remember diamonds are formed under pressure...

Still doing nothing down to 144 currently in quite a long downtrend

Edit 9 1:44

Still trending down some people in chat a speculating institutional holdings have changed but I see only a 2% decrease and the keep borrowing shares so I don't think that's having that great of an effect. Just no volume and consistent shorting on the back of the market downtrend earlier.

Edit 5 11:13

Failed the test at 152.5 some sell walls are up between 153-156 someone wants the price below that resistance this week. Lots of puts came in out of the money for 5/21 not sure on this yet but I will look into it later.

Failed the VWAP crossover and head and shouldering down to new intraday lows

Bouncing as the overall market begins to stabilize and recover

Edit 2 9:50

Looks like we are stable for a second if we bounce we could just return to our opening price or test 162.5

Edit 1 9:41

Whole market is down but nice dip opportunities, I think we will keep dropping till the market stabilizes. Low volume still 300k.
