Hola simios,

Soy yo Gherkinit, here with another day of munching down my favorite crayon flavors, todays flavor green is brought to you by T+13 theories and possible enactment of NSCC 801. GameStop is definitely moving towards zero liquidity as yesterday we saw international buy orders coming back unfilled. It would seem as though MM don't mind counterfeiting short shares ex. 750k available to borrow even though no buyback occurred on the open market to replenish them. But I guess they are now done printing IOU's for apes, internationally at least.

Come to America the only country were you can still buy GameStop!

After-market Wrap

Here are our stats for today. Looks like the lowest volume day YTD by over 1M shares. We only closed down .77%. Not much to say today but I hope I kept it interesting.

Thank you all for the support !

I'll see you bright and early tomorrow for another fun day of trading !

Edit 13 3:00

Tried and failed, also, yes, it took that long to test 162.5

Edit 12 2:15

Tested 162.5 and looks like it's going to try again

Edit 11 1:50

Moving up to test VWAP we are on track for a new historically low volume day.

Literally nothing.

Edit 9 12:38

Massive Head and shoulders looking pretty weak. Volume low might dip back to 157~ as we slipped on the re-test of resistance.

Edit 8 12:01

dropped down as actual MM got angry about my blatant manipulation retesting VWAP

Edit 7 11:33

I'm being accused of manipulating the market but it seems to be working, stay tuned for "10 secrets MM don't want you to know".

Edit 6 11:10

Trending up to test 162.5 volume is pretty low so I expect any test to be rejected.

Edit 5 10:52

Chopping along VWAP nothing to see here.

Edit 4 10:20

bounced at 158.8 looks like another test of VWAP then possibly 162.5. Market now sideways.

Edit 3 10:05

Yay! more Market Correction Sales. This can bring us down a bit much like yesterday.

Edit 2 9:44

Descending channel forming, we are actually holding the line pretty well given today's overall market performance.

Edit 1 9:40

550k Shares Borrowed to short so I expect there will be some turbulence if the stock tries to go up

Seems like it will be fighting for the 162.5 resistance for now. 263k Volume

Pre-Market Analysis

Pre-Edit 1

First I wanted to show everyone a quick look at that Bull pennant for this week. We are still in it after a really low volume battle at 157 yesterday we crept back into the 157-162.5 channel with a bit of cushion on VWAP

<https://preview.redd.it/n3xi9ir7oax61.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=f80b35570d9efc654bb552598e7c2e0c0f7f2e9e>

It also looks like we had a nice gap-up to a peak of 165 in after-market. Filling the gap down from Monday's after-market.

CV-VWAP still looks neutral. We had some arbitrage on the dip yesterday, but nothing major.
