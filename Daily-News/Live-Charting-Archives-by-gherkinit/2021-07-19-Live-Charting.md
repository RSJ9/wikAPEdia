Good Morning !

I hope you all had a great weekend, but for me personally , thank god it's over.

While I am expecting some serious price action this week as we battle it out for $180, if we could see a lot of volatility especially with the market looking the way it currently does. Hodl.

After-Market

Slow day low volume but we beat the market! I was hoping for a test of 180 today but I definitely still expect one in AH or pre-market, Tomorrow should be very interesting as it is the t+2 from Friday I covered in the weekly DD. Still well within our ascending triangle for the week. Thank you all and I'll see you tomorrow morning at 9am.

Finally breaking free of that chop a bit to the upside market coming back a bit too. I still think a test of 180 is in the cards for today

Edit 2 10:21

Double bottom bounce on GME market relieving some of that downward pressure but VIX is shooting up. Looks like we are in for a crazy day

Edit 1 9:57

GME Coming down with the SPY right now we have pretty strong resistance at 157 but I expect if the market losses accelerate we could see a big dip on GME/ fire sale

Pre-Market Analysis

pre-edit 1 8:54

VIX spiking super hard

The SPY dropped down to tested and fell through that initial correction zone. If our volume is low today we will get dragged around by the market, I also expect we will see a significant spike in the VIX. GME volume currently around 30k with 25k shares to borrow it (Fidelity still hard to borrow) it doesn't look like we will be getting shorted a lot in the traditional sense but I will be monitoring the options chain for SHF fuckery.

GME already doing some volatile things in pre-market
