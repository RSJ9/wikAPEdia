Happy Bastille Day to all the Cornichons !

and Good Morning SuperStonk!

I was fucking around with my crayons last night trying to sharpen my Magic MintTM.¬†While try to jam it into the back of the box I noticed something while staring intently at ADX all of these things are like the other.

After Hours

Holy shit that was a rough ride, finally got some blood pumping in my pickle after all these days down .xx - 2.00% I thought the shorts just didn't care anymore. I guess their $31M in Puts today would say they do care quite a lot.

Edit 3 11:49

ITM puts keep racking up they are trying very hard and spending lots of money to push the price down today upcoming FED meeting and overall market downtrend aren't a huge help here either

Edit 2 10:48

Market's on a downtrend looks like a red day but we had an ok bounce at 175 that pattern I found earlier on the ADX looks like we could have another down day or 2 before moving up.

Pre-Market Analysis

Significantly more volume this morning at 26k with 150k shares available to borrow. While we haven't see a lot go on with the stock today there has been an all out whale war going on on the options chain this week as low IV has incentivized long whale to play leveraged positions, I expect this to really pick up today as we get buffeted about MM's attempting to remain¬†[delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp).
