Good Morning Apes!

The long funds have already begun building the gamma ramp up again behind the price drop as can be seen reflected here in the increase of OTM calls this week.

Contract volume bought at or near ask for week of 7/30

As we can see the longs are buying cheap OTM calls and the shorts are buying expensive ITM calls to drive the price down as can be seen here in dollars spent

Capital flow into GME options for week of 7/30

I will try to explain this long strategy as simply as I can because this is the third week in a row it has occurred.

Bear Trap Flowchart (de-hedged is not proper terminology but easy to understand)

This is one of the primary reasons we are not seeing a lot of volume as the longs are aware that the shorts are the seller and the buyer they simply have to wait. This is what I like to call the SHFCJ (Short Hedge Fund Circle Jerk) Eventually once they are done slathering themselves with mayo there will always be this gamma trap waiting for them. Thank you for attending my TED talk.

After Market

Down on dry volume still a significant amount of ITM puts being bought to continue the drive down. I suspect the 200k shares used yesterday were the reason for our run up today as they were returned shortly thereafter. More SHFCJ another day of buy & hodl. Thank you all and have a wonderful night.

Getting slammed down but holding the line at 164 nice dip buy opportunity at the lower average price.

Edit 4 11:53

right back down again, to be honest a lot of this is only due to the fact that we have low volume and a wide bid/ask spread

Triple bottom just crossed VWAP while volume is low we could see a test at 170 off this momentum

Pre-Market Analysis

Well the action yesterday seems to have jumped started the stock a bit as volume in pre-market is already significantly higher than previous days these last couple weeks. I expect we will see an early test of 180 as we have bounced on the low support several times now. 15k shares to borrow this morning the 200k used in yesterdays attack have not been returned.

15M chart from 7/28 - 7/29

MACD had a bullish crossover, then a bearish crossover yesterday and today it looks like it's crossing back to bullish. I sort of said this could happen as low volume meant that MACD hadn't crossed over in a significant way. Remember this indicator is trailing.
