Hey everyone,

As most of you have heard by now I was put in a position where I was forced to resign as a moderator

The past few weeks have been hard on the mod team, there where some problems and everyone has made some errors.

For me personally it came last week when I got a slew of messages of people complaining about another moderator, yournameisc00l being banhappy, and there was something wrong with the discord as well. and a moderator trying to show off power by removing my posts as well.

when I confronted c00l I wasn't getting any answers on any regards, flat out stating he would wait on the others. This in turn made me very paranoid as all hell. Then checking out the discord suddenly all the channels where gone for me except the one specifically made for me to take notes on DD. Knowing that channel was only visible to moderators I demanded answers now and did a @ everyone.

As far as I know this will only give a message to the moderators, but apparently this gave a server wide message to every user ,which is weird because as far as I know only mods can view mod channels.

Then I also reacted to a comment here on the sub, saying I have no clue what's going on with the Discord server, I am no longer a moderator there but I'll look into it. <this made a big problem apparently and was asked to delete it, so I did along with the message on discord.

and then got flack for deleting the message on discord because it made it so that there was confusion.

If that message did go out to everyone in the server I am very sorry, but given the laissez faire attitude I was getting from mr c00l and getting no responses from everyone my paranoia kicked into overdrive because I foresaw this as a WSB 2.0 situation.

This in combination with the "nahuh I'll wait for the rest" attitude of mr cool had left me to take away his mod powers until the rest of the group could chime in.

(something the rest would do to [u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/) once I was ill this past weekend.)

Now this same mod also banned Warden, I told the rest no wait because I wanted to talk to them and warden to make sure we could resolve this situation to at least not end in a permaban, as I did see it as a mistake at the time, as I believe there should be some communication going both ways and I do think context matters.Later I called for a meeting, stating I no longer believed mr c00l had the best interest of the sub in mind.

they claiming I was a bad team player, which a case could certainly be made for, that I was self-aggrandizing which I don't agree with and saying I was doing this for self serving things which... again I don't personally see.

These things have lead the rest of the mod team to "vote" to kick me out, this was not a choice made by me but for me, I even wanted to stay on with limited mod powers to be able to at least help in some way or form. but no dice. and was asked to resign as a mod myself because of public image.

I do have to state, I do however respect Chickthief and thr0wthis4ccount4way, the two mods I have no clue on how the new mods from discord are as I had 1 or 2 sentences I talked with 0Wl and he was very nice to me.

I was always transparent with everyone here and would like to continue in doing so, thereby my writeup here and now.

I fully expect to be banned for speaking out, even though it's factually, and realize this could be my last post on [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/)

I will most likely take my time and think about where I want to go from here, and am contemplating if I should continue with my daily's or not, as my intentions never changed but because I got kicked from the mod team it has given me food for thought.

I wish everyone here the best regardless, I will be 💎👐 no matter what.

If I do end up getting banned I will most likely be in [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) [r/Spielstopp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spielstopp/) or another one.Again I first need to figure out if I even want to do it anymore, and I'll be posting this message to both.

I wish everyone the best

Edit:

[r/gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme/) has already deleted my post so... <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mkgolv/synopsis_for_0405/>

It was removed because of "promotion" and "tagging the mods, as you can see for yourself in the above message (it was copy pasted) there is no promotion or tagging of mods. Make from this what you want :)

EDIT 2:\
I've just heard the mods of [r/gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme/) are getting death threats

DO NOT DO THIS

Seriously regardless how you think of them, that is NOT the way we do business.

I will not stand for that, I've received threats like this, pixel has and they are horrible.

Regardless of how you feel about them be adults. They don't deserve threats, if you disagree with them disagree as an adult and voice your concerns. anyone posting death threats to anyone will get a permaban from me personally.

To the mods of [r/gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme/) I am truly sorry you have to deal with this and I hope you know I am not ok with these messages in any way shape or form.
