When settling debts between parties, the current system allows an

"agreement between the parties provides for an adjustment unknown to DTC. The parties can settle the adjustment away from DTC or one of the parties can submit a manual adjustment via the APO service. Unfortunately, manual processing of adjustments via the APO service is subject to a number of shortcomings. For example, the adjustments are not subject to DTC's risk controls"

They are trying to make the debt claim process more transparent and streamlined, especially with their own risk parameters.

TLDR: DTCC wants everyone to be like the Lannisters.
