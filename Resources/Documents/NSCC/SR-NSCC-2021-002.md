1. Text of the Proposed Rule Change
(a) The proposed rule change of National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”)
is annexed hereto as Exhibit 5 and consists of modifications to Rule 4(A) (Supplemental
Liquidity Deposits) of the NSCC’s Rules & Procedures (“Rules”) to (1) calculate and collect,
when applicable, supplemental liquidity deposits to NSCC’s Clearing Fund (“Supplemental
Liquidity Deposits,” or “SLD”) on a daily basis rather than only in advance of the monthly
expiration of stock options (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Options Expiration Activity Period”);
(2) establish an intraday SLD obligation that would apply in advance of Options Expiration
Activity Periods and may also be applied on other days, as needed; (3) implement an alternative
pro rata calculation of Members’ SLD obligations that may apply in certain circumstances; and
(4) simplify and improve the transparency of the description of the calculation, collection and
treatment of SLD in Rule 4(A) of the Rules, as described in greater detail below.1
(b) Not applicable.
(c) Not applicable.
2. Procedures of the Self-Regulatory Organization
The proposal was approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors of NSCC
on May 21, 2020.
3. Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis
for, the Proposed Rule Change
(a) Purpose
NSCC is proposing to enhance its management of the liquidity risks that arise in or are
borne by it by calculating and collecting, when applicable, SLD on each Business Day rather
than only in advance of Options Expiration Activity Periods. The proposed changes would
establish an intraday SLD obligation that would apply in advance of Options Expiration Activity
Periods and may be applicable on any Business Day, as needed. The proposal would also
implement an alternative pro rata calculation of Members’ SLD obligations that may apply in
certain circumstances. Finally, in connection with these proposed changes, NSCC would
simplify and improve the description of the calculation, collection and treatment of SLD in Rule
4(A). These proposed rule changes are described in greater detail below.
(i) Overview of the NSCC Liquidity Risk Management
NSCC, along with its affiliates, The Depository Trust Company and Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation, maintains a Clearing Agency Liquidity Risk Management Framework
(“Framework”) that sets forth the manner in which NSCC measures, monitors and manages the
1
 Capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Rules, available at
http://dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf. 
Page 4 of 79
liquidity risks that arise in or are borne by it.2
 As a central counterparty, NSCC’s liquidity needs
are driven by the requirement to complete end-of-day money settlement, on an ongoing basis, in
the event NSCC ceases to act for a Member (hereinafter referred to as a “default”).3
 If a Member
defaults, NSCC needs to complete settlement of guaranteed transactions on the defaulted
Member’s behalf from the date of default through the remainder of the settlement cycle. As
such, and as provided for in the Framework, NSCC measures the sufficiency of its qualifying
liquid resources through daily liquidity studies across a range of scenarios, including amounts
NSCC would need in the event the Member or Member family with the largest aggregate
liquidity exposure defaults.4

As described in the Framework, NSCC seeks to maintain qualifying liquid resources in
an amount sufficient to cover this risk. These resources currently include (1) cash deposits to the
NSCC Clearing Fund;5
 (2) the proceeds of the issuance and private placement of (a) short-term,
unsecured notes in the form of commercial paper and extendable notes (“Commercial Paper
Program”),6
 and (b) term debt (“Term Debt Issuance”);7
 (3) cash that would be obtained by
drawing on NSCC’s committed 364-day credit facility with a consortium of banks (“Line of
Credit”);8
 and (4) Supplemental Liquidity Deposits, collected pursuant to Rule 4(A), which are
currently designed to cover the heightened liquidity exposure arising around Options Expiration

 The Rules identify when NSCC may cease to act for a Member and the types of actions
NSCC may take. For example, NSCC may suspend a firm’s membership with NSCC or
prohibit or limit a Member’s access to NSCC’s services in the event that Member
defaults on a financial or other obligation to NSCC. See Rule 46 (Restrictions on Access
to Services) of the Rules, supra note 1.

Activity Periods, required from those Members whose activity would pose the largest liquidity
exposure to NSCC.9

NSCC’s liquidity risk management has evolved in order to adhere to regulatory
requirements that were adopted after Rule 4(A) was implemented.10 As part of its efforts to
maintain compliance with these requirements, NSCC has continued to strengthen its liquidity
risk management strategy, including through growing and diversifying its qualifying liquid
resources. In connection with these ongoing efforts, NSCC is proposing to calculate and collect,
when applicable, SLD every Business Day rather than only in connection with Options
Expiration Activity Periods. This proposed change would improve NSCC’s ability to measure
and monitor its daily liquidity exposures and allow it to collect additional qualifying liquid
resources from Members whose activity poses the largest liquidity exposure to NSCC in
connection with their daily settlement activity, and not only during Options Expiration Activity
Periods. By measuring SLD against Members’ actual daily settlement activity and NSCC’s
available qualifying liquid resources, the proposal would also help mitigate risks to NSCC that it
is unable to secure adequate default liquidity from other sources in an amount necessary to meet
its liquidity needs. For example, the proposal would help mitigate the risks that could arise if
investor demand for the short-term notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program weakens,
there is limited investor demand for term debt issued pursuant to a Term Debt Issuance, or
NSCC is unable to renew its Line of Credit at the targeted amount.
NSCC is also proposing to establish an intraday SLD obligation that would apply on the
first Business Day of the Options Expiration Activity Period to allow NSCC to continue to
mitigate the additional liquidity exposures presented by options activity. The proposal would
also permit NSCC to calculate and collect an intraday SLD on any Business Day when, for
example, NSCC believes that it is necessary to collect an additional SLD from a Member whose
activity presents relatively greater risks to the NSCC on an overnight basis.
NSCC is also proposing to implement an alternative calculation of Members’ SLD
requirements that would be their pro rata allocation of the largest SLD obligation calculated for
that Business Day. This proposed change would provide NSCC with the discretion, in certain
circumstances, to allocate its largest liquidity need on a Business Day among those Members that
are required to pay SLD on that day rather than collect separate SLD from those Members, as
described in greater detail below.
In connection with these proposed changes, NSCC would also simplify the description of
the calculation of SLD in Rule 4(A) in order to improve the transparency of this Rule, as
described in greater detail below.

(ii) Current Rule 4(A) and Supplemental Liquidity Deposits
Under the current Rule 4(A), NSCC collects SLD from the unaffiliated Members and
families of affiliated Members (each defined as an “Affiliated Family”) that incur the largest
gross settlement debits over the settlement cycle during times of increased trading activity that
arise around Options Expiration Activity Periods.11
Under the current Rule 4(A), NSCC performs calculations on a monthly basis, no later
than the fifth day prior to an Options Expiration Activity Period, using activity observed over a
24-month lookback period (defined in the current Rule 4(A) as the “Special Activity Lookback
Period”).12 These calculations determine (1) NSCC’s largest liquidity need that exceeded its
liquidity resources (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Special Activity Peak Liquidity Need”); and (2) the
30 (or fewer) unaffiliated Members or Affiliated Families (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Special
Activity Liquidity Providers”) that presented the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC (defined in
Rule 4(A) as “Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposures”).13 To determine the SLD obligations
of each Special Activity Liquidity Provider, the calculated Special Activity Peak Liquidity Need
of NSCC is allocated to these Special Activity Liquidity Providers in proportion to the Special
Activity Peak Liquidity Exposures they presented to NSCC during the Special Activity
Lookback Period. Special Activity Liquidity Providers are required to fund their SLD
obligations by the close of business on the second day prior to the applicable Options Expiration
Activity Period.14 SLD may be returned to Special Activity Liquidity Providers seven Business
Days after the end of the applicable Options Expiration Activity Period.15
On any Business Day between calculation dates, if NSCC observes an increase in its
liquidity needs that exceeds a predetermined threshold amount, it may call for an additional
deposit from the Member whose increase in activity levels caused (or was the primary cause of)
such increased liquidity need (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Special Activity Liquidity Call”).16
NSCC may hold deposits made pursuant to a Special Activity Liquidity Call for up to 90 days
after the deposit is made.17 Members are also permitted to submit a cash deposit to the Clearing
Fund as a “Special Activity Prefund Deposit” no later than the first Business Day of an Options

Expiration Activity Period.18 NSCC understands that a Member would generally make a Special
Activity Prefund Deposit when it anticipates that its Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposure
during that period may be greater than the amount calculated by NSCC pursuant to Rule 4(A)
based on activity in the Special Activity Lookback Period.19
The current Rule 4(A) also addresses how SLD are treated generally.20 Specifically,
while SLD are part of a Member’s actual deposit to the Clearing Fund, they are made in addition
to a Member’s Required Fund Deposit and any other deposit of any such Member to the Clearing
Fund.21 Rule 4(A) also provides that SLD may be invested and may be used to satisfy a loss or
liability as provided for in Sections 3 or 13 of Rule 4, and addresses NSCC’s obligation to
provide Members with certain information that would help them anticipate their potential SLD
requirements.22
(iii) Amended Rule 4(A) and Proposed Daily Calculation of Supplemental
Liquidity Deposits
In order to better address the liquidity risks presented by Members’ daily activity, NSCC
is proposing to amend Rule 4(A) to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business
Day rather than only in connection with the monthly expiration of stock options. While the
monthly expiration of stock options does present larger liquidity exposures to NSCC, NSCC may
also face large liquidity exposures from Members’ daily activity, particularly during volatile
market conditions. By allowing NSCC to calculate and collect SLD daily, NSCC would be able
to identify these exposures based on Members’ daily activity rather than estimate its upcoming
liquidity exposures based on activity observed over a lookback period. The proposal would help
NSCC mitigate its liquidity risks through the daily collection of SLD from those Members’
whose daily activity would, in the event of the Member’s default, create a potential liquidity
need that is in excess of NSCC’s available qualifying liquid resources. The proposal would also
permit NSCC to return SLD to Members on the Business Day following the day those deposits
are collected and would remove the current requirement that SLD be held for up to 90 days.
In order to implement this proposed change to the timing of the SLD, NSCC would make
a number of changes to Rule 4(A), described below. The proposed changes to Rule 4(A) would
implement a daily calculation and collection of SLD, simplify and clarify the calculations done
in connection with the SLD requirements, and enhance the disclosures of the SLD requirements.
18 See definition of “Special Activity Prefund Deposit” in Section 2 of Rule 4(A)
(Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of the Rules, id.
19 See id.
20 See Section 13 of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of the Rules, id.
21 See Section 13(b) of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of the Rules, id.
22 See Section 13(c) and Section 14 of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of the
Rules, id. 
Page 8 of 79
Despite these proposed changes, the structure of Rule 4(A) and the fundamental mechanics of
the SLD requirements would be unchanged.
Proposed Daily Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits
Supplemental Liquidity Providers. Under the proposed Rule 4(A), each Business Day
NSCC would determine the 30 (or fewer) Members (each such Member a “Supplemental
Liquidity Provider”) that had the “Peak Liquidity Need,” which would be defined as the largest
Daily Liquidity Need that NSCC would have for that Member or Affiliated Family in a
“Lookback Period.” 23 For purposes of this calculation, Daily Liquidity Need would be defined
as the amount of liquid resources needed to effect the settlement of NSCC’s payment obligations
as a central counterparty over a three day settlement cycle, assuming the default of that Member
on that day.
As described above, Supplemental Liquidity Providers are currently identified by
reviewing Members’ Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposures over the Lookback Period.
Under the proposed approach, NSCC would base this determination on Members’ Peak Liquidity
Need, which would continue to identify those Members whose activity posed the largest liquidity
risks to NSCC during the Lookback Period. The proposed approach would no longer require a
calculation using NSCC’s available liquid resources on each day in the Lookback Period but
would use a simpler approach by looking only at liquidity need. The proposed approach to use a
simpler calculation would reduce the risk of error and would clarify the description of how
NSCC would identify Supplemental Liquidity Providers in the proposed Rule 4(A), making it
more predictable to Members.
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation. After NSCC determines the Supplemental Liquidity
Providers, NSCC would then determine if any of the Supplemental Liquidity Providers would be
required to pay an SLD on that Business Day. The proposed Rule 4(A) would use a simplified
calculation by determining if the Daily Liquidity Need for each Supplemental Liquidity Provider
on that Business Day exceeds the sum of NSCC’s qualifying liquid resources available to NSCC
on that day, assuming stressed market conditions (described below) (defined in the proposed
Rule 4(A) as “Qualifying Liquid Resources”). The result of that calculation would be a
Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s SLD requirement (defined in the proposed Rule 4(A) as a
“Supplemental Liquidity Obligation”) for that day. If the Daily Liquidity Need of a
Supplemental Liquidity Provider does not exceed NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid Resources on that
day, then it would not have a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation.
Because this calculation would be done at the start of each Business Day (as discussed
further below), it would be based on the Qualifying Liquid Resources, including Required Fund
Deposits to the Clearing Fund, available to NSCC as of the end of the prior Business Day.
23 The “Lookback Period” would continue to be defined as 24 months, or a longer period as
determined by NSCC in its discretion. NSCC may adjust the Lookback Period if, for
example, unusual activity observed in the Lookback Period is not an appropriate indicator
of future settlement activity and causes a Member to be a Supplemental Liquidity
Provider. See Section 2 (Defined Terms) of Rule 4(A), id. 
Page 9 of 79
Additionally, in order to anticipate market conditions that could cause Qualifying Liquid
Resources to be unavailable on that day, NSCC would apply stress scenarios in determining its
total Qualifying Liquid Resources for purposes of Rule 4(A). Currently, NSCC applies stress
scenarios in determining the Special Activity Daily Liquidity Need and, in practice, they are
currently applied to the Other Qualifying Liquid Resources in this calculation under the current
Rule 4(A).24 The proposed change would allow NSCC to continue to assume stressed markets in
its SLD calculations, which protects it against unexpected market events.25 The proposed
changes to Rule 4(A) would make it clearer how these stress scenarios are applied.
Under this proposed calculation, NSCC would no longer need to estimate the potential
liquidity need a Member’s activity could pose to NSCC based on activity that settled in the
Lookback Period. Instead, the Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of a Member would be
calculated based on the actual liquidity exposure that its daily activity would pose to NSCC on
that particular day in the event of that Member’s default. The proposed change provides both
NSCC and Members with a more reliable measure of the liquidity risks posed to NSCC by its
Members’ daily settlement activity in calculating SLD requirements.
Each Supplemental Liquidity Provider that has a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on a
Business Day would receive a notice from NSCC of the amount of its Supplemental Liquidity
Obligation and would be required to make a deposit in that amount to the Clearing Fund within
one hour of such notice. The proposed timing of funding a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation
would mirror the current requirement that is applied to Members’ Required Fund Deposits,
which is also calculated and collected daily, and must be funded within one hour of demand.26
Specifically, NSCC expects to deliver notification of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations to
Supplemental Liquidity Providers by around 8:30 AM ET each Business Day, with deposits
required by no later than 9:30 AM ET.
Proposed Pro Rata Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations. As an alternative
to the calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations described above, proposed Rule 4(A)
would also state that, in the event two or more Supplemental Liquidity Providers have a
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of more than $2 billion on a Business Day, calculated
pursuant to the calculation described above, NSCC may determine the Supplemental Liquidity
24 Current Rule 4(A) uses the defined term “Other Qualifying Liquid Resources” to refer to
NSCC’s qualifying liquid resources other than the Clearing Fund and the Line of Credit.
See Section 2 of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of the Rules, id.
25 NSCC would apply the same stress scenarios that it currently applies, which include the
market shocks of 1987, and removing the largest commitment to the Line of Credit,
excess deposits to the Clearing Fund on deposit and proceeds from issued commercial
paper that is maturing within five Business Days from NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid
Resource. Any changes to these stress scenarios would be announced by an Important
Notice posted to NSCC’s website.
26 See Section II(B) of Procedure XV (Clearing Fund Formula and Other Matters) of the
Rules, supra note 1. 
Page 10 of 79
Obligation of all Supplemental Liquidity Providers on that day would be their pro rata share of
the largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation calculated on that Business Day.27
This proposed alternative calculation of the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations would
provide NSCC with the option of collecting only the largest SLD calculated on a Business Day,
allocated among each of the Supplemental Liquidity Providers. The purpose of this proposed
provision is to provide NSCC with the option of collecting enough funds to meet its regulatory
requirements in circumstances when the aggregate Supplemental Liquidity Obligations on a
particular day would significantly exceed that amount. Therefore, NSCC has structured this
provision to be available only if two or more Supplemental Liquidity Providers owe SLD of
more than $2 billion. NSCC has never had two more Supplemental Liquidity Providers owe
more than $2 billion in SLD on a calculation date since Rule 4(A) was adopted. Therefore,
NSCC believes this alternative calculation would only be available in very limited
circumstances. Furthermore, NSCC believes the threshold of $2 billion is appropriate as it
would only permit this alternative calculation in circumstances when it would have a material
impact on the allocation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations among the Supplemental
Liquidity Providers.
In such circumstances, when multiple Members have relatively large Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations of more than $2 billion, NSCC would have the option to determine if it is
appropriate to collect the largest SLD calculated for that Business Day, divided pro rata among
the Supplemental Liquidity Providers rather than collect the each of the Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations of those firms. NSCC may determine, for example, that, in certain market
conditions, this approach would be appropriate to alleviate liquidity pressures on Supplemental
Liquidity Providers. This alternative calculation would allow NSCC to collect sufficient
qualifying liquid resources to meet its regulatory obligations with respect to liquidity risk
management without requiring all of the Supplemental Liquidity Providers to fund the total
amount of their calculated Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on that Business Day.28
27 As an example, the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations for three Supplemental Liquidity
Providers on a Business Day are – Member A: $6 billion, Member B: $2 billion and
Member C: $1 billion. If NSCC determines, in its sole discretion, to calculate their
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations on a pro-rata basis, then their Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations would be – Member A: $4 billion (or 6/9 of the largest
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of $6 billion), Member B: $1.3 billion (or 2/9 of the
$6 billion) and Member C: $700 million (or 1/9 of the $6 billion). The notice provided to
each Supplemental Liquidity Provider on that Business Day would inform those
Members that this pro-rata calculation was applied.
28 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) under the Act requires, in part, that NSCC maintain sufficient
liquid resources at the minimum to effect same-day settlement of payment obligations
with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios,
including the default of the participant family that would generate the largest aggregate
payment obligation for the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market
conditions. 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(i). 
Page 11 of 79
Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls. The proposed Rule 4(A) would also establish
Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls that would replace the current Special Activity Liquidity
Calls. The existing Special Activity Liquidity Calls are designed to address increases in NSCC’s
liquidity need between calculation dates. The proposed Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls
would serve a similar function, allowing NSCC to calculate and collect additional SLD on an
intraday basis if a Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s increased activity levels or projected
settlement activity causes NSCC’s Daily Liquidity Need to exceed NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid
Resources. This proposed provision would assist NSCC in mitigating increased liquidity
exposures in specified circumstances.
First, proposed Rule 4(A) would establish a monthly Intraday Supplemental Liquidity
Call that is calculated and collected, when applicable, on the first Business Day of an Options
Expiration Activity Period, which is typically a Friday.29 This Intraday Supplemental Liquidity
Call would be calculated as the difference between (1) NSCC’s Daily Liquidity Need,
recalculated to account for both actual settlement activity submitted to NSCC over the course of
Business Day and projected activity in stock options that is expected to be submitted to NSCC30
and (2) NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid Resources. Settlement activity may net with (and offset) the
activity that NSCC uses in re-calculating the Daily Liquidity Need. In order to account for any
potential offsetting settling activity, NSCC would adjust the re-calculated Daily Liquidity Need
using an estimated netting percentage that is based on each Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s
average percentage of netting observed over the prior 24 months. Under this proposed provision,
NSCC would adjust the amount of SLD it collects in order to mitigate the increased liquidity
exposures related to the monthly expiration of stock options.
Second, proposed Rule 4(A) would allow NSCC to call for additional SLD on an intraday
basis on any Business Day if a Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s increased activity levels
causes NSCC’s Daily Liquidity Need to exceed NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid Resources and
NSCC determines, in its sole discretion, that it is appropriate to require an additional intraday
SLD from that Supplemental Liquidity Provider in order to mitigate those additional liquidity
exposures. Under this proposed change, NSCC would have the ability to make an Intraday
Supplemental Liquidity Call on any Business Day. The amount of an Intraday Supplemental
Liquidity Call would be the difference between NSCC’s Daily Liquidity Need, recalculated for
that Business Day taking into account any increase in settlement activity, and NSCC’s
Qualifying Liquid Resources. This proposed provision would allow NSCC to adjust the amount
of SLD it collects for a Business Day in circumstances when NSCC believes it is necessary to
29 The proposed Rule 4(A) will retain the existing definition of an Options Expiration
Activity Period for purposes of this monthly Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Call.
30 Each Business Day, NSCC receives information regarding projected settlement activity
from The Options Clearing Corporation pursuant to a Stock and Futures Settlement
Agreement (“OCC Accord”). The OCC Accord provides for the clearance and settlement
of exercises and assignments of options on eligible securities or the maturity of eligible
stock futures contracts through NSCC. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 81260
(July 31, 2017), 82 FR 36484 (August 4, 2017) (File Nos. SR-NSCC-2017-803;
SR-OCC-2017-804). 
Page 12 of 79
accelerate the collection of additional SLD from Supplemental Liquidity Providers whose
activity may present relatively greater risks to the NSCC on an overnight basis. NSCC would
determine if an Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Call is appropriate based on a variety of factors
and circumstances, including, but not limited to, an assessment of a Supplemental Liquidity
Provider’s ability to meet its projected settlement or Supplemental Liquidity Obligations and
estimates of settlement activity that could offset settlement exposures and are not reflected in
NSCC’s liquidity estimates.
Returns of SLD and Miscellaneous Matters. Proposed Rule 4(A) would provide that
NSCC would return SLD, including any SLD funded pursuant to an Intraday Supplemental
Liquidity Call, on the next Business Day unless such amounts are held longer by NSCC pursuant
to proposed Section 12a of Rule 4(A), as described below. Under the current Rule 4(A), NSCC
may hold SLD for up to seven Business Days after the end of the applicable Options Expiration
Activity Period and may hold SLD funded pursuant to a Special Activity Liquidity Call for up to
90 days after such deposit is made. Under the proposed change, because NSCC would
recalculate the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations each Business Day, NSCC would no longer
need to hold SLD for these extended periods.
NSCC would amend proposed Section 12a (currently Section 13a) of Rule 4(A) to clarify
that SLD, as part of Members’ actual deposit to the Clearing Fund, would be subject to the
provision of Section 9 of Rule 4. Section 9 of Rule 4 addresses NSCC’s right to withhold all or
any part of any excess deposit of a Member if such Member has been placed on the Watch List
pursuant to the Rules or if NSCC determines that the Member’s anticipated activities in NSCC in
the near future may reasonably be expected to be materially different than its activities of the
recent past.31 Current Section 13a of Rule 4(A) addresses how SLD are treated pursuant to other
Rules, particularly Rule 4, which addresses Members’ deposits to the Clearing Fund. While this
proposal would not change NSCC’s rights with respect to these funds, it would provide Members
with greater transparency into how SLD are treated under Rule 4.
NSCC would also amend the provision in Rule 4(A) that addresses when SLD would be
returned to a Member that ceases to be a participant. Currently, Rule 4(A) states that SLD are
not subject to Section 7 of Rule 4 (which addresses how Required Fund Deposits are returned to
retired Members) and, as such, are returned to retired Members as otherwise provided for in Rule
4(A).32 Under the proposed Rule 4(A), because NSCC would be able to calculate SLD each
Business Day, it would return SLD on the Business Day following the calculation date.
However, while a firm may still have unsettled activity on the day it retires, NSCC would not be
able to collect SLD on the days following a Member’s retirement. Therefore, NSCC is
proposing to amend Rule 4(A) to require that SLD of a retired Member be treated similarly to
other cash Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund and be held by NSCC for 30 calendar
31 For example, this may occur when an index rebalancing occurs shortly after a month-end
options expiration period, which could cause an increase in NSCC’s liquidity exposures.
32 Section 7 of Rule 4 provides that Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund in the
form of cash and securities are returned to retired Members within 30 calendar days after
all of its transactions have settled and obligations have been satisfied. See supra note 1. 
Page 13 of 79
days after any of its open transactions have settled and obligations have been satisfied. This
proposed change would protect NSCC from liquidity risks presented by open transactions in the
days following a firm’s retirement and would align the treatment of these funds with the
treatment of Required Fund Deposits of retired Members.
The proposed Rule 4(A) would also simplify the additional miscellaneous provisions
applicable to SLD, which address, for example, NSCC’s right to debit Members’ accounts at
NSCC if a Supplemental Liquidity Provider fails to meet its Supplemental Liquidity Obligation,
and the information NSCC makes available to Supplemental Liquidity Providers each Business
Day regarding SLD calculations. While the proposed changes would update and simplify these
provisions, they would not significantly alter the structure of these provisions, as described
below.
Proposed Changes to Rule 4(A)
The proposal described above would be implemented into the Rules by amending the
current Rule 4(A). The specific changes to implement the proposal are described below.
Section 1 (Overview). NSCC is proposing changes to Section 1 of Rule 4(A) to simplify
the descriptions by removing outdated and unnecessary language. Section 1 of Rule 4(A) would
continue to provide the rationale for the SLD requirement, by describing NSCC’s liquidity needs
and how the SLD requirements are designed to contribute to meeting those needs. However, the
proposed changes would simplify this section by removing a statement that specifically identifies
two of NSCC’s principal sources of liquidity and would instead more generally refer to NSCC’s
sources of liquidity. The proposed changes to Section 1 of Rule 4(A) would also remove
references to options expiration activity periods, which would no longer be applicable to the
SLD requirement under this proposal.
Section 2 (Defined Terms). NSCC is proposing several changes to Section 2 of Rule 4(A)
in order to implement this proposal. As described below, the proposed changes to the defined
terms address the change in timing of the SLD requirement to occur each Business Day and
would improve the transparency of Rule 4(A) through simplified and clearer defined terms.
First, Section 2 of proposed Rule 4(A) would remove the definition of “Special Activity
Calculation Date,” which is tied to the monthly Options Expiration Activity Period, and instead
would use the term “Business Day” throughout proposed Rule 4(A), where appropriate.
Business Day is currently defined in Rule 1 as any day on which NSCC is open for business.
Therefore, this proposed change would provide for the calculation of SLD requirements on each
day that NSCC is open for business.
Second, Section 2 of the proposed Rule 4(A) revise other defined terms that use the
phrase “Special Activity” to either remove that phrase or, when appropriate, to replace this
phrase with the term “Supplemental.” For example, NSCC would revise the defined term
“Special Activity Daily Liquidity Need” to “Daily Liquidity Need,” and would revise the defined
term “Special Activity Liquidity Provider” to “Supplemental Liquidity Provider.” The phrase
“Special Activity” was used in the current Rule 4(A) to refer to the Options Expiration Activity
Period, which would only be applicable to the monthly intraday SLD in the proposed Rule 4(A). 
Page 14 of 79
NSCC would also update the definition of Daily Liquidity Need to change a reference
from a four-day settlement cycle to a three-day settlement cycle, to reflect the amendment to
Rule 15c6-1(a) under the Act to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer
transactions.33 Additionally, NSCC would move the defined term for “Options Expiration
Activity Period” within Section 2 of the proposed Rule 4(A) so it continues to appear
alphabetically, but is not proposing to change the definition of this term.
Third, the proposed changes to Section 2 of Rule 4(A) would include one defined term
for “Qualifying Liquid Resources” to refer to all default liquidity resources available to NSCC to
settle its payment obligations as a central counterparty. As discussed in greater detail above, the
defined term would provide that NSCC may apply stressed market assumptions to its Qualifying
Liquid Resources when applying these resources in the calculations made under Rule 4(A). In
connection with this proposed change, NSCC would remove the defined terms “Commitment”
and “Credit Facility,” which were used in the current Rule 4(A) to refer to NSCC’s Line of
Credit, and would remove “Other Qualifying Liquid Resources,” which was used to refer to
NSCC’s liquid resources other than the Clearing Fund and the Line of Credit. This proposed
change would simplify Rule 4(A) and would account for NSCC’s continuing efforts to expand
and diversify its default liquidity resources. The proposed change would also clarify that
Qualifying Liquid Resources would not include SLD for purposes of the calculations in Rule
4(A).
Fourth, the proposed changes would move certain calculations out of the defined terms in
Section 2 and include them in the relevant later sections of Rule 4(A). This proposed change
would simplify and clarify Rule 4(A), which currently requires a reader to refer back to the
defined terms in Section 2 when reading the calculations and requirements set forth in later
sections of Rule 4(A). For example, Section 2 of Rule 4(A) currently includes the calculation of
“Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposure” and “Special Activity Peak Liquidity Need.” In the
proposed Rule 4(A), NSCC would no longer use the calculation of Special Activity Peak
Liquidity Exposure in determining the Supplemental Liquidity Providers or in calculating those
requirements. The calculation of Peak Liquidity Need, which would replace Special Activity
Peak Liquidity Need, would be moved out of Section 2 and into Section 3, where that calculation
would be described as being used to identify Supplemental Liquidity Providers.
Finally, the proposed changes to Section 2 of Rule 4(A) would remove defined terms that
are no longer needed when NSCC calculates SLD requirements daily. For example, NSCC
would remove defined terms that are related to the Options Expiration Activity Period, including
“Special Activity Business Day,” which is currently defined as a Business Day included in an
Options Expiration Activity Period. NSCC would also remove the defined term for “Special
Activity Prefund Deposit” because it would no longer be necessary for Members to prefund their
potential SLD requirement in advance of NSCC’s calculations when they are done on a daily
basis.
Section 3 (Supplemental Liquidity Providers). NSCC is proposing to amend Section 3 to
describe how NSCC would identify the Supplemental Liquidity Providers for each Business
33 See 17 CFR 240.15c6-1. 
Page 15 of 79
Day. Section 3 of the proposed Rule 4(A) would state that, each Business Day, NSCC would
determine the Peak Liquidity Need of each Member during the Lookback Period, and would
identify the Supplemental Liquidity Providers for that Business Day as the 30 (or fewer)
Members with the largest Peak Liquidity Need in that time period. These changes would
implement the proposal described in greater detail above to make this calculation daily and to
simplify the calculation used to identify Supplemental Liquidity Providers by using Peak
Liquidity Need rather than using the largest exposures of all providers in the Lookback Period.
Section 4 (Supplemental Liquidity Obligations); Section 5 (Satisfaction of Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations); and Section 6 (Notice of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations and
Payment of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits). NSCC would amend Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule
4(A) to describe the simplified calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations, and the
process by which Supplemental Liquidity Providers would pay their Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations after being notified by NSCC. Proposed changes to Section 4 would implement the
revised calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations, described in greater detail above, as
the difference between a Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s Daily Liquidity Need for that
Business Day and the Qualifying Liquid Resources available to NSCC on that day. The
proposed changes would also create a subsection b. of Section 4 to describe the optional,
alternative pro rata calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations, as described in greater
detail above.
Proposed changes to Sections 5 and 6 of Rule 4(A) would update the defined terms and
the timing by when Supplemental Liquidity Providers must fund their Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations to reflect the change of these obligations to daily. Proposed changes to Section 6 of
Rule 4(A) would state that the notice provided to Supplemental Liquidity Providers regarding
their Supplemental Liquidity Obligations would state if that amount was calculated pursuant to
Section 4b as a pro rata share of the largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of that Business
Day.
Section 7 (Determination of Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls) and Section 8
(Satisfaction of Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls). NSCC would amend Sections 7 and 8 of
Rule 4(A) to reflect the removal of the Special Activity Liquidity Calls and the adoption of the
two Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls, as described in greater detail above. The proposed
changes to these sections would also update defined terms, as appropriate.
Returns of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits – Section 9 (Deposits Made in Satisfaction of
a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation) and Section 10 (Ceasing to be a Participant). NSCC is
proposing to consolidate the current Sections 9 and 10 of Rule 4(A) into a new Section 9 of Rule
4(A), which would address the return of SLD that are made in satisfaction of both Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations and Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls. The proposed changes would
provide that SLD made pursuant to either Supplemental Liquidity Obligations and Intraday
Supplemental Liquidity Calls would be returned to Supplemental Liquidity Providers on the next
Business Day after the calculation date, unless otherwise notified by NSCC.
NSCC would amend Section 10 (currently Section 11) to align the treatment of SLD of a
retired Member with the treatment of such firm’s Required Fund Deposits, as described in
greater detail above. 
Page 16 of 79
Miscellaneous Matters – Section 11 (Obligations of Affiliated Families and Supplemental
Liquidity Providers), Section 12 (Application of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) and Section 13
(Information). NSCC would amend Sections 11, 12 and 13 (currently Sections 12, 13 and 14) of
Rule 4(A) to update and simplify these provisions. The proposed amendments would not
substantially amend the purpose or application of these sections.
Section 11 (currently Section 12) of Rule 4(A) provides that the Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations of Affiliated Families are the several obligations of all of the Members of the
Affiliated Family ratably in proportion to their applicable Special Activity Peak Liquidity
Exposure. NSCC would not change this provision but would update it to use revised defined
terms. NSCC would also amend Section 11 by consolidating two parallel paragraphs into
subsection b., which address NSCC’s right to collect SLD from Supplemental Liquidity
Providers. This proposed change would simplify the provision but would not make substantive
changes to NSCC’s rights or Members’ obligations.
Section 12 (currently Section 13), which addresses how SLD are treated under Rule 4,
would be amended to update defined terms and to clarify that SLD may be held by NSCC as part
of Members’ actual deposits to the Clearing Fund, pursuant to Section 9 of Rule 4. No
substantive changes are proposed to this Section.
Section 13 (currently Section 14) describes NSCC’s obligation to provide Members with
certain information regarding its SLD calculation. NSCC is proposing to amend this section to
include updated defined terms and to reflect the daily calculation of SLD.
(iv) Impact Study Results
NSCC has provided the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) with the
results of an impact study that reviewed the proposal against the observed regulatory liquidity
needs and NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid Resources available during the period from 2016 through
2020 to assess both pro-forma and hypothetical impacts of the proposal under various liquidity
scenarios.
Pro-Forma Impact Study. The pro-forma impact study compared NSCC’s regulatory
liquidity needs against the Qualifying Liquid Resources that were available between 2016 and
2020. The pro-forma analysis indicated that NSCC would expect between 1 and 3 Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations per year, ranging in size between $1.0 billion to $5.4 billion in 2016
through 2019. In calendar year 2020, the impact study shows that available Qualifying Liquid
Resources for each date would have eliminated potential Supplement Liquidity Obligations.
Additionally, this impact study showed between 4 and 27 actual Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations were received by NSCC per year, typically averaging $3.6 billion during this same
period, including 9 actual Supplemental Liquidity Obligations received by NSCC in 2020.
Hypothetical Impact Study. NSCC also developed several hypothetical liquidity
scenarios to assess the proposal’s impact. When hypothetical Qualifying Liquid Resources
available to NSCC are between $17 billion and $22 billion, NSCC would expect between 7 and
36 Supplemental Liquidity Obligations per year, ranging in size between $2.1 billion to $4.6
billion each; and (2) when the hypothetical Qualifying Liquid Resources available to NSCC are 
Page 17 of 79
$22 billion or above, NSCC would expect between 1 and 5 Supplemental Liquidity Obligations
per year, ranging in size between $2.1 billion to $6.8 billion each.
NSCC has also provided the Commission with details of potential impacts of the proposal
on the largest 50 Affiliated Families, a list of the 30 Affiliated Families with the largest liquidity
exposures as of December 31, 2020, and the respective Affiliated Families’ maximum and
average NSCC liquidity needs for each calendar year between 2016 and 2020.
(v) Implementation Timeframe
NSCC would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 Business Days after the
later of the approval of the proposed rule change and no objection to the related advance notice34
by the Commission. NSCC would announce the effective date of the proposed changes by
Important Notice posted to its website.
 (b) Statutory Basis
NSCC believes the proposed changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a registered clearing agency. In particular,
NSCC believes the proposed changes are consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act,35 and
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii), each promulgated under the Act,36 for the reasons described
below.
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of NSCC be designed to, among
other things, assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control
of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible.37 NSCC believes the proposed rule change
is designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in its custody or control
or for which it is responsible because the proposal would allow NSCC to better limit its liquidity
exposure to Members in the event of a Member default.
Specifically, under the proposal, each Business Day NSCC would measure the
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of each Supplemental Liquidity Provider as the difference
between the Daily Liquidity Need of the Supplemental Liquidity Provider calculated for that
Business Day and the Qualifying Liquid Resources available to NSCC on that day assuming
34 NSCC filed this proposed rule change as an advance notice (File No. SR-NSCC2021-801) with the Commission pursuant to Section 806(e)(1) of Title VIII of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act entitled the Payment, Clearing,
and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010, 12 U.S.C. 5465(e)(1), and Rule 19b-4(n)(1)(i)
under the Act, 17 CFR 240.19b-4(n)(1)(i). A copy of the advance notice is available at

stressed market conditions. By making these calculations daily based on Members’ current
activity and NSCC’s resources currently available to NSCC, the proposed SLD requirement
would provide NSCC with a more accurate measure of its potential liquidity exposures to its
Members in the event of a Member default. The proposal would also establish a monthly
intraday SLD collection in connection with options expiration activity that present heighted
liquidity exposures, and an optional intraday SLD that NSCC may collect when it deems
appropriate to mitigate any increased liquidity exposures or in light of other circumstances.
These proposed intraday SLD would allow NSCC to re-calculate its liquidity exposures and
collect sufficient liquidity to allow it to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the
default of a Member.
Additionally, by providing an alternative pro rata calculation of Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations in certain circumstances, the proposal would provide NSCC with the flexibility to
determine the total amount collected on a Business Day, while continuing to collect and hold
sufficient liquidity to allow NSCC to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default
of the Member with the largest payment obligations. In this way, the proposed change to
calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD on a daily basis based on current information, and
on an intraday basis when NSCC observes an increase in its Daily Liquidity Need, would help
NSCC assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for
which it is responsible, consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.38
The proposed changes to simplify and clarify Rule 4(A), which describes the SLD
requirement, would also be consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the
Act.39 These proposed changes would make the rights and obligations of both NSCC and its
Members under Rule 4(A) more transparent and easier to understand. A clearer rule supports the
ability of Members to meet their obligations to provide NSCC with SLD when required. The
liquidity provided to NSCC through the SLD allows it to complete end-of-day settlement in the
event of the default of a Member. Therefore, by making the provisions of Rule 4(A) clearer,
simpler and more transparent to Members, these proposed changes also support NSCC’s
compliance with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act to assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds which are in NSCC’s custody or control or for which it is responsible.40
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) under the Act requires that NSCC establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain sufficient liquid
resources at the minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate,
intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under
a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the
participant family that would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation for NSCC in
extreme but plausible market conditions.41 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) under the Act requires that

41 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(i). 
Page 19 of 79
NSCC establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to hold qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the minimum liquidity resource
requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) in each relevant currency for which NSCC has
payment obligations owed to its Members.42
As described above, the proposal would strengthen NSCC’s ability to maintain sufficient
liquidity to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a Member. The
proposal would do this by allowing NSCC to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every
Business Day from those Members that pose the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC on that day.
The proposal would also include a mechanism to allow NSCC to collect SLD on an intraday
basis, including on the first Business Day of the Options Expiration Activity Period, when
liquidity exposures are historically higher. These resources would be available to NSCC to
complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a Member. Further, SLD are
currently, and would continue to be, held by NSCC at either its cash deposit account at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at a creditworthy commercial bank, or in other investments
pursuant to the Clearing Agency Investment Policy.43 Therefore, SLD would continue to be
considered a qualifying liquid resource, as defined by Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) under the Act,44 and
would support NSCC’s ability to hold qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the
minimum liquidity resource requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i), as required by Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii). Additionally, the proposed alternative pro rata calculation of Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations would provide NSCC with the flexibility to determine the total amount
collected on a Business Day, while continuing to collect and hold sufficient liquidity to allow
NSCC to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of the Member with the
largest payment obligations, as required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i).45 As such, this proposed
change would support NSCC’s ability to hold sufficient qualifying liquid resources to meet its
minimum liquidity resource requirement under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii).46
4. Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statement on Burden on Competition
NSCC believes that the proposed rule change could have an impact on competition.
Specifically, NSCC believes the proposed changes could burden competition because they would
require those Members that are identified as Supplemental Liquidity Providers to make an SLD
42 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii). For purposes of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii), “qualifying
liquid resources” are defined in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) as including, in part, cash held
either at the central bank of issue or at creditworthy commercial banks. Supra note 4.
43 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 79528 (December 12, 2016), 81 FR 91232
(December 16, 2016) (File Nos. SR-DTC-2016-007, SR-FICC-2016-005, SR-NSCC2016-003); 84949 (December 21, 2018), 83 FR 67779 (December 31, 2018) (File Nos.

to the Clearing Fund each Business Day, when applicable, rather than only monthly in
connection with the expiration of stock options.
Members are currently subject to SLD requirements under Rule 4(A), and, while the
proposed rule change could result in a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on a more frequent
basis, the impact study results, discussed above, show that the proposal would not have a
significant impact on the frequency or amount of those requirements. The Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations of Supplemental Liquidity Providers would be in direct relation to the
specific liquidity exposures presented to NSCC by Members’ daily activity. Therefore,
Members that present the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC, regardless of the type of Member,
currently have, and would continue to have, similar SLD requirements. The proposed alternative
calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations would provide NSCC with the flexibility to
collect and hold sufficient liquidity to meet NSCC’s regulatory obligations while allocating the
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations on a pro rata basis among the Supplemental Liquidity
Providers for that Business Day. This proposed change would treat each Supplemental Liquidity
Provider equally when this alternative calculation is triggered.
Therefore, NSCC believes that any burden on competition imposed by the proposed
changes would not be significant and, further, would be both necessary and appropriate in
furtherance of NSCC’s efforts to mitigate risks and meet the requirements of the Act,47 as
described in this filing and further below.
NSCC believes the above described burden on competition that may be created by the
proposed changes to the SLD requirement would be necessary in furtherance of the purposes of
the Act, specifically Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.48 As discussed above, the proposed
change would improve NSCC’s ability to estimate its liquidity exposures in the calculation and
collection of SLD by using daily activity rather than estimating potential exposures based on
activity in a look-back period. The proposal would also establish a monthly intraday SLD to
address the additional liquidity exposures that are presented by monthly options expiration
activity, and an optional intraday SLD that may be collected when NSCC deems appropriate. In
aggregate, the total SLD collected would improve NSCC’s liquidity risk management by
supplementing its liquidity resources that are available to it to complete end-of-day settlement in
the event of the default of a Member. The proposed pro rata alternative calculation of SLD
would allow NSCC to opt to collect only the largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation
calculated for that Business Day, while still meeting NSCC’s applicable regulatory obligations.
The proposed enhancements to its liquidity risk management would help NSCC assure the
safeguarding of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is
responsible, consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.49
NSCC believes the proposed changes would also support its compliance with Rules
17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) under the Act, which require NSCC to establish, implement, maintain

and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to (x) maintain sufficient liquid
resources at the minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate,
intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under
a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the
participant family that would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation for NSCC in
extreme but plausible market conditions,50 and (y) hold qualifying liquid resources sufficient to
meet the minimum liquidity resource requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) in each relevant
currency for which NSCC has payment obligations owed to its Members.51
The proposal would strengthen NSCC’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to
complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a Member by allowing NSCC to
collect SLD each Business Day from those Members that pose the largest liquidity exposures to
NSCC on that day. Further, SLD are currently, and would continue to be, cash deposits to
NSCC’s Clearing Fund, which meet the criteria to be considered qualifying liquid resources, as
defined by Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) under the Act.52 The proposed alternative pro rata calculation
would allow NSCC to continue to collect sufficient liquidity to meet the requirements of Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7)(i).53 As such, this proposed change would support NSCC’s ability to hold
sufficient qualifying liquid resources to meet its minimum liquidity resource requirement under
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii).54
NSCC believes that the above described burden on competition that could be created by
the proposed changes would be appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because
such changes have been designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in
the custody or control of NSCC or for which it is responsible, as described in detail above.
Under both the current Rule 4(A) and the proposed changes to Rule 4(A), the SLD requirements
are designed to require those Members whose settlement activity pose the largest liquidity
exposures to NSCC to provide SLD in the amount of such exposures. The proposed changes to
Rule 4(A) would better support NSCC by allowing it to calculate and collect, when applicable,
SLD to address liquidity exposures that are presented by the activity of Supplemental Liquidity
Providers each Business Day rather than only during monthly options expiration periods. The
proposed rule change would improve NSCC’s ability to measure these liquidity exposures by
using daily activity rather than estimations based on past activity.
Therefore, because the proposed changes are designed to provide NSCC with a more
accurate measure of the liquidity risks presented by Members’ daily activity, NSCC believes the
proposal would meet NSCC’s risk management goals and its regulatory obligations. NSCC
believes that it has designed the proposed rule change in an appropriate way in order to comply

(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for,
the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
NSCC is proposing to enhance its management of the liquidity risks that arise in
or are borne by it by calculating and collecting, when applicable, SLD on each Business
Day rather than only in advance of Options Expiration Activity Periods. The proposed

changes would establish an intraday SLD obligation that would apply in advance of
Options Expiration Activity Periods and may be applicable on any Business Day, as
needed. The proposal would also implement an alternative pro rata calculation of
Members’ SLD obligations that may apply in certain circumstances. Finally, in
connection with these proposed changes, NSCC would simplify and improve the
description of the calculation, collection and treatment of SLD in Rule 4(A). These
proposed rule changes are described in greater detail below.
(i) Overview of the NSCC Liquidity Risk Management
NSCC, along with its affiliates, The Depository Trust Company and Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation, maintains a Clearing Agency Liquidity Risk Management
Framework (“Framework”) that sets forth the manner in which NSCC measures,
monitors and manages the liquidity risks that arise in or are borne by it.5
 As a central
counterparty, NSCC’s liquidity needs are driven by the requirement to complete end-ofday money settlement, on an ongoing basis, in the event NSCC ceases to act for a
Member (hereinafter referred to as a “default”).6
 If a Member defaults, NSCC needs to
complete settlement of guaranteed transactions on the defaulted Member’s behalf from
the date of default through the remainder of the settlement cycle. As such, and as
provided for in the Framework, NSCC measures the sufficiency of its qualifying liquid
5
 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 82377 (December 21, 2017), 82 FR
61617 (December 28, 2017) (File Nos. SR-DTC-2017-004; SR-FICC-2017-008;
SR-NSCC-2017-005).
6
 The Rules identify when NSCC may cease to act for a Member and the types of
actions NSCC may take. For example, NSCC may suspend a firm’s membership
with NSCC or prohibit or limit a Member’s access to NSCC’s services in the
event that Member defaults on a financial or other obligation to NSCC. See Rule
46 (Restrictions on Access to Services) of the Rules, supra note 4. 
Page 27 of 79
resources through daily liquidity studies across a range of scenarios, including amounts
NSCC would need in the event the Member or Member family with the largest aggregate
liquidity exposure defaults.7

As described in the Framework, NSCC seeks to maintain qualifying liquid
resources in an amount sufficient to cover this risk. These resources currently include
(1) cash deposits to the NSCC Clearing Fund;8
 (2) the proceeds of the issuance and
private placement of (a) short-term, unsecured notes in the form of commercial paper and
extendable notes (“Commercial Paper Program”),9
 and (b) term debt (“Term Debt
Issuance”);10 (3) cash that would be obtained by drawing on NSCC’s committed 364-day
credit facility with a consortium of banks (“Line of Credit”);11 and (4) Supplemental
Liquidity Deposits, collected pursuant to Rule 4(A), which are currently designed to
cover the heightened liquidity exposure arising around Options Expiration Activity

 “Qualifying liquid resources” are defined in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) under the Act.

qualifying liquid resources that incorporates by reference Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14).

Periods, required from those Members whose activity would pose the largest liquidity
exposure to NSCC.12
NSCC’s liquidity risk management has evolved in order to adhere to regulatory
requirements that were adopted after Rule 4(A) was implemented.13 As part of its efforts
to maintain compliance with these requirements, NSCC has continued to strengthen its
liquidity risk management strategy, including through growing and diversifying its
qualifying liquid resources. In connection with these ongoing efforts, NSCC is proposing
to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business Day rather than only in
connection with Options Expiration Activity Periods. This proposed change would
improve NSCC’s ability to measure and monitor its daily liquidity exposures and allow it
to collect additional qualifying liquid resources from Members whose activity poses the
largest liquidity exposure to NSCC in connection with their daily settlement activity, and
not only during Options Expiration Activity Periods. By measuring SLD against
Members’ actual daily settlement activity and NSCC’s available qualifying liquid
resources, the proposal would also help mitigate risks to NSCC that it is unable to secure
adequate default liquidity from other sources in an amount necessary to meet its liquidity
needs. For example, the proposal would help mitigate the risks that could arise if
investor demand for the short-term notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program

also Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 70999 (December 5, 2013), 78 FR

2013), 78 FR 75400 (December 11, 2013) (File No. SR-NSCC-2013-802).

Page 29 of 79
weakens, there is limited investor demand for term debt issued pursuant to a Term Debt
Issuance, or NSCC is unable to renew its Line of Credit at the targeted amount.
NSCC is also proposing to establish an intraday SLD obligation that would apply
on the first Business Day of the Options Expiration Activity Period to allow NSCC to
continue to mitigate the additional liquidity exposures presented by options activity. The
proposal would also permit NSCC to calculate and collect an intraday SLD on any
Business Day when, for example, NSCC believes that it is necessary to collect an
additional SLD from a Member whose activity presents relatively greater risks to the
NSCC on an overnight basis.
NSCC is also proposing to implement an alternative calculation of Members’
SLD requirements that would be their pro rata allocation of the largest SLD obligation
calculated for that Business Day. This proposed change would provide NSCC with the
discretion, in certain circumstances, to allocate its largest liquidity need on a Business
Day among those Members that are required to pay SLD on that day rather than collect
separate SLD from those Members, as described in greater detail below.
In connection with these proposed changes, NSCC would also simplify the
description of the calculation of SLD in Rule 4(A) in order to improve the transparency
of this Rule, as described in greater detail below.
(ii) Current Rule 4(A) and Supplemental Liquidity Deposits
Under the current Rule 4(A), NSCC collects SLD from the unaffiliated Members
and families of affiliated Members (each defined as an “Affiliated Family”) that incur the 
Page 30 of 79
largest gross settlement debits over the settlement cycle during times of increased trading
activity that arise around Options Expiration Activity Periods.14
Under the current Rule 4(A), NSCC performs calculations on a monthly basis, no
later than the fifth day prior to an Options Expiration Activity Period, using activity
observed over a 24-month lookback period (defined in the current Rule 4(A) as the
“Special Activity Lookback Period”).15 These calculations determine (1) NSCC’s largest
liquidity need that exceeded its liquidity resources (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Special
Activity Peak Liquidity Need”); and (2) the 30 (or fewer) unaffiliated Members or
Affiliated Families (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Special Activity Liquidity Providers”) that
presented the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Special
Activity Peak Liquidity Exposures”).16 To determine the SLD obligations of each
Special Activity Liquidity Provider, the calculated Special Activity Peak Liquidity Need
of NSCC is allocated to these Special Activity Liquidity Providers in proportion to the
Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposures they presented to NSCC during the Special
Activity Lookback Period. Special Activity Liquidity Providers are required to fund their
SLD obligations by the close of business on the second day prior to the applicable
Options Expiration Activity Period.17 SLD may be returned to Special Activity Liquidity

note 4.

17 See Section 4 of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of the Rules, id. 
Page 31 of 79
Providers seven Business Days after the end of the applicable Options Expiration
Activity Period.18
On any Business Day between calculation dates, if NSCC observes an increase in
its liquidity needs that exceeds a predetermined threshold amount, it may call for an
additional deposit from the Member whose increase in activity levels caused (or was the
primary cause of) such increased liquidity need (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Special
Activity Liquidity Call”).19 NSCC may hold deposits made pursuant to a Special
Activity Liquidity Call for up to 90 days after the deposit is made.20 Members are also
permitted to submit a cash deposit to the Clearing Fund as a “Special Activity Prefund
Deposit” no later than the first Business Day of an Options Expiration Activity Period.21
NSCC understands that a Member would generally make a Special Activity Prefund
Deposit when it anticipates that its Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposure during that
period may be greater than the amount calculated by NSCC pursuant to Rule 4(A) based
on activity in the Special Activity Lookback Period.22
The current Rule 4(A) also addresses how SLD are treated generally.23
Specifically, while SLD are part of a Member’s actual deposit to the Clearing Fund, they

Page 32 of 79
are made in addition to a Member’s Required Fund Deposit and any other deposit of any
such Member to the Clearing Fund.24 Rule 4(A) also provides that SLD may be invested
and may be used to satisfy a loss or liability as provided for in Sections 3 or 13 of Rule 4,
and addresses NSCC’s obligation to provide Members with certain information that
would help them anticipate their potential SLD requirements.25
(iii) Amended Rule 4(A) and Proposed Daily Calculation of
Supplemental Liquidity Deposits
In order to better address the liquidity risks presented by Members’ daily activity,
NSCC is proposing to amend Rule 4(A) to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD
every Business Day rather than only in connection with the monthly expiration of stock
options. While the monthly expiration of stock options does present larger liquidity
exposures to NSCC, NSCC may also face large liquidity exposures from Members’ daily
activity, particularly during volatile market conditions. By allowing NSCC to calculate
and collect SLD daily, NSCC would be able to identify these exposures based on
Members’ daily activity rather than estimate its upcoming liquidity exposures based on
activity observed over a lookback period. The proposal would help NSCC mitigate its
liquidity risks through the daily collection of SLD from those Members’ whose daily
activity would, in the event of the Member’s default, create a potential liquidity need that
is in excess of NSCC’s available qualifying liquid resources. The proposal would also
permit NSCC to return SLD to Members on the Business Day following the day those
24 See Section 13(b) of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of the Rules,
id.
25 See Section 13(c) and Section 14 of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits)
of the Rules, id. 
Page 33 of 79
deposits are collected and would remove the current requirement that SLD be held for up
to 90 days.
In order to implement this proposed change to the timing of the SLD, NSCC
would make a number of changes to Rule 4(A), described below. The proposed changes
to Rule 4(A) would implement a daily calculation and collection of SLD, simplify and
clarify the calculations done in connection with the SLD requirements, and enhance the
disclosures of the SLD requirements. Despite these proposed changes, the structure of
Rule 4(A) and the fundamental mechanics of the SLD requirements would be unchanged.
Proposed Daily Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits
Supplemental Liquidity Providers. Under the proposed Rule 4(A), each Business
Day NSCC would determine the 30 (or fewer) Members (each such Member a
“Supplemental Liquidity Provider”) that had the “Peak Liquidity Need,” which would be
defined as the largest Daily Liquidity Need that NSCC would have for that Member or
Affiliated Family in a “Lookback Period.” 26 For purposes of this calculation, Daily
Liquidity Need would be defined as the amount of liquid resources needed to effect the
settlement of NSCC’s payment obligations as a central counterparty over a three day
settlement cycle, assuming the default of that Member on that day.
As described above, Supplemental Liquidity Providers are currently identified by
reviewing Members’ Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposures over the Lookback
26 The “Lookback Period” would continue to be defined as 24 months, or a longer
period as determined by NSCC in its discretion. NSCC may adjust the Lookback
Period if, for example, unusual activity observed in the Lookback Period is not an
appropriate indicator of future settlement activity and causes a Member to be a
Supplemental Liquidity Provider. See Section 2 (Defined Terms) of Rule 4(A),
id. 
Page 34 of 79
Period. Under the proposed approach, NSCC would base this determination on
Members’ Peak Liquidity Need, which would continue to identify those Members whose
activity posed the largest liquidity risks to NSCC during the Lookback Period. The
proposed approach would no longer require a calculation using NSCC’s available liquid
resources on each day in the Lookback Period but would use a simpler approach by
looking only at liquidity need. The proposed approach to use a simpler calculation would
reduce the risk of error and would clarify the description of how NSCC would identify
Supplemental Liquidity Providers in the proposed Rule 4(A), making it more predictable
to Members.
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation. After NSCC determines the Supplemental
Liquidity Providers, NSCC would then determine if any of the Supplemental Liquidity
Providers would be required to pay an SLD on that Business Day. The proposed Rule
4(A) would use a simplified calculation by determining if the Daily Liquidity Need for
each Supplemental Liquidity Provider on that Business Day exceeds the sum of NSCC’s
qualifying liquid resources available to NSCC on that day, assuming stressed market
conditions (described below) (defined in the proposed Rule 4(A) as “Qualifying Liquid
Resources”). The result of that calculation would be a Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s
SLD requirement (defined in the proposed Rule 4(A) as a “Supplemental Liquidity
Obligation”) for that day. If the Daily Liquidity Need of a Supplemental Liquidity
Provider does not exceed NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid Resources on that day, then it would
not have a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation.
Because this calculation would be done at the start of each Business Day (as
discussed further below), it would be based on the Qualifying Liquid Resources, 
Page 35 of 79
including Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund, available to NSCC as of the end
of the prior Business Day. Additionally, in order to anticipate market conditions that
could cause Qualifying Liquid Resources to be unavailable on that day, NSCC would
apply stress scenarios in determining its total Qualifying Liquid Resources for purposes
of Rule 4(A). Currently, NSCC applies stress scenarios in determining the Special
Activity Daily Liquidity Need and, in practice, they are currently applied to the Other
Qualifying Liquid Resources in this calculation under the current Rule 4(A).27 The
proposed change would allow NSCC to continue to assume stressed markets in its SLD
calculations, which protects it against unexpected market events.28 The proposed
changes to Rule 4(A) would make it clearer how these stress scenarios are applied.
Under this proposed calculation, NSCC would no longer need to estimate the
potential liquidity need a Member’s activity could pose to NSCC based on activity that
settled in the Lookback Period. Instead, the Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of a
Member would be calculated based on the actual liquidity exposure that its daily activity
would pose to NSCC on that particular day in the event of that Member’s default. The
proposed change provides both NSCC and Members with a more reliable measure of the
27 Current Rule 4(A) uses the defined term “Other Qualifying Liquid Resources” to
refer to NSCC’s qualifying liquid resources other than the Clearing Fund and the
Line of Credit. See Section 2 of Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity Deposits) of
the Rules, id.
28 NSCC would apply the same stress scenarios that it currently applies, which
include the market shocks of 1987, and removing the largest commitment to the
Line of Credit, excess deposits to the Clearing Fund on deposit and proceeds from
issued commercial paper that is maturing within five Business Days from NSCC’s
Qualifying Liquid Resource. Any changes to these stress scenarios would be
announced by an Important Notice posted to NSCC’s website. 
Page 36 of 79
liquidity risks posed to NSCC by its Members’ daily settlement activity in calculating
SLD requirements.
Each Supplemental Liquidity Provider that has a Supplemental Liquidity
Obligation on a Business Day would receive a notice from NSCC of the amount of its
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation and would be required to make a deposit in that
amount to the Clearing Fund within one hour of such notice. The proposed timing of
funding a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation would mirror the current requirement that is
applied to Members’ Required Fund Deposits, which is also calculated and collected
daily, and must be funded within one hour of demand.29 Specifically, NSCC expects to
deliver notification of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations to Supplemental Liquidity
Providers by around 8:30 AM ET each Business Day, with deposits required by no later
than 9:30 AM ET.
Proposed Pro Rata Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations. As an
alternative to the calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations described above,
proposed Rule 4(A) would also state that, in the event two or more Supplemental
Liquidity Providers have a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of more than $2 billion on
a Business Day, calculated pursuant to the calculation described above, NSCC may
determine the Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of all Supplemental Liquidity Providers
on that day would be their pro rata share of the largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation
calculated on that Business Day.30
29 See Section II(B) of Procedure XV (Clearing Fund Formula and Other Matters) of
the Rules, supra note 4.
30 As an example, the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations for three Supplemental
Liquidity Providers on a Business Day are – Member A: $6 billion, Member B:
$2 billion and Member C: $1 billion. If NSCC determines, in its sole discretion, 
Page 37 of 79
This proposed alternative calculation of the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations
would provide NSCC with the option of collecting only the largest SLD calculated on a
Business Day, allocated among each of the Supplemental Liquidity Providers. The
purpose of this proposed provision is to provide NSCC with the option of collecting
enough funds to meet its regulatory requirements in circumstances when the aggregate
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations on a particular day would significantly exceed that
amount. Therefore, NSCC has structured this provision to be available only if two or
more Supplemental Liquidity Providers owe SLD of more than $2 billion. NSCC has
never had two more Supplemental Liquidity Providers owe more than $2 billion in SLD
on a calculation date since Rule 4(A) was adopted. Therefore, NSCC believes this
alternative calculation would only be available in very limited circumstances.
Furthermore, NSCC believes the threshold of $2 billion is appropriate as it would only
permit this alternative calculation in circumstances when it would have a material impact
on the allocation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations among the Supplemental
Liquidity Providers.
In such circumstances, when multiple Members have relatively large
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations of more than $2 billion, NSCC would have the
option to determine if it is appropriate to collect the largest SLD calculated for that
Business Day, divided pro rata among the Supplemental Liquidity Providers rather than
to calculate their Supplemental Liquidity Obligations on a pro-rata basis, then
their Supplemental Liquidity Obligations would be – Member A: $4 billion (or
6/9 of the largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of $6 billion), Member B:
$1.3 billion (or 2/9 of the $6 billion) and Member C: $700 million (or 1/9 of the
$6 billion). The notice provided to each Supplemental Liquidity Provider on that
Business Day would inform those Members that this pro-rata calculation was
applied. 
Page 38 of 79
collect the each of the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations of those firms. NSCC may
determine, for example, that, in certain market conditions, this approach would be
appropriate to alleviate liquidity pressures on Supplemental Liquidity Providers. This
alternative calculation would allow NSCC to collect sufficient qualifying liquid resources
to meet its regulatory obligations with respect to liquidity risk management without
requiring all of the Supplemental Liquidity Providers to fund the total amount of their
calculated Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on that Business Day.31
Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls. The proposed Rule 4(A) would also
establish Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls that would replace the current Special
Activity Liquidity Calls. The existing Special Activity Liquidity Calls are designed to
address increases in NSCC’s liquidity need between calculation dates. The proposed
Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls would serve a similar function, allowing NSCC to
calculate and collect additional SLD on an intraday basis if a Supplemental Liquidity
Provider’s increased activity levels or projected settlement activity causes NSCC’s Daily
Liquidity Need to exceed NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid Resources. This proposed
provision would assist NSCC in mitigating increased liquidity exposures in specified
circumstances.
First, proposed Rule 4(A) would establish a monthly Intraday Supplemental
Liquidity Call that is calculated and collected, when applicable, on the first Business Day
31 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) under the Act requires, in part, that NSCC maintain
sufficient liquid resources at the minimum to effect same-day settlement of
payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of
foreseeable stress scenarios, including the default of the participant family that
would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation for the covered clearing
agency in extreme but plausible market conditions. 17 CFR 240.17Ad22(e)(7)(i). 
Page 39 of 79
of an Options Expiration Activity Period, which is typically a Friday. 32 This Intraday
Supplemental Liquidity Call would be calculated as the difference between (1) NSCC’s
Daily Liquidity Need, recalculated to account for both actual settlement activity
submitted to NSCC over the course of Business Day and projected activity in stock
options that is expected to be submitted to NSCC33 and (2) NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid
Resources. Settlement activity may net with (and offset) the activity that NSCC uses in
re-calculating the Daily Liquidity Need. In order to account for any potential offsetting
settling activity, NSCC would adjust the re-calculated Daily Liquidity Need using an
estimated netting percentage that is based on each Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s
average percentage of netting observed over the prior 24 months. Under this proposed
provision, NSCC would adjust the amount of SLD it collects in order to mitigate the
increased liquidity exposures related to the monthly expiration of stock options.
Second, proposed Rule 4(A) would allow NSCC to call for additional SLD on an
intraday basis on any Business Day if a Supplemental Liquidity Provider’s increased
activity levels causes NSCC’s Daily Liquidity Need to exceed NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid
Resources and NSCC determines, in its sole discretion, that it is appropriate to require an
additional intraday SLD from that Supplemental Liquidity Provider in order to mitigate
32 The proposed Rule 4(A) will retain the existing definition of an Options
Expiration Activity Period for purposes of this monthly Intraday Supplemental
Liquidity Call.
33 Each Business Day, NSCC receives information regarding projected settlement
activity from The Options Clearing Corporation pursuant to a Stock and Futures
Settlement Agreement (“OCC Accord”). The OCC Accord provides for the
clearance and settlement of exercises and assignments of options on eligible
securities or the maturity of eligible stock futures contracts through NSCC. See
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 81260 (July 31, 2017), 82 FR 36484
(August 4, 2017) (File Nos. SR-NSCC-2017-803; SR-OCC-2017-804). 
Page 40 of 79
those additional liquidity exposures. Under this proposed change, NSCC would have the
ability to make an Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Call on any Business Day. The
amount of an Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Call would be the difference between
NSCC’s Daily Liquidity Need, recalculated for that Business Day taking into account any
increase in settlement activity, and NSCC’s Qualifying Liquid Resources. This proposed
provision would allow NSCC to adjust the amount of SLD it collects for a Business Day
in circumstances when NSCC believes it is necessary to accelerate the collection of
additional SLD from Supplemental Liquidity Providers whose activity may present
relatively greater risks to the NSCC on an overnight basis. NSCC would determine if an
Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Call is appropriate based on a variety of factors and
circumstances, including, but not limited to, an assessment of a Supplemental Liquidity
Provider’s ability to meet its projected settlement or Supplemental Liquidity Obligations
and estimates of settlement activity that could offset settlement exposures and are not
reflected in NSCC’s liquidity estimates.
Returns of SLD and Miscellaneous Matters. Proposed Rule 4(A) would provide
that NSCC would return SLD, including any SLD funded pursuant to an Intraday
Supplemental Liquidity Call, on the next Business Day unless such amounts are held
longer by NSCC pursuant to proposed Section 12a of Rule 4(A), as described below.
Under the current Rule 4(A), NSCC may hold SLD for up to seven Business Days after
the end of the applicable Options Expiration Activity Period and may hold SLD funded
pursuant to a Special Activity Liquidity Call for up to 90 days after such deposit is made.
Under the proposed change, because NSCC would recalculate the Supplemental 
Page 41 of 79
Liquidity Obligations each Business Day, NSCC would no longer need to hold SLD for
these extended periods.
NSCC would amend proposed Section 12a (currently Section 13a) of Rule 4(A) to
clarify that SLD, as part of Members’ actual deposit to the Clearing Fund, would be
subject to the provision of Section 9 of Rule 4. Section 9 of Rule 4 addresses NSCC’s
right to withhold all or any part of any excess deposit of a Member if such Member has
been placed on the Watch List pursuant to the Rules or if NSCC determines that the
Member’s anticipated activities in NSCC in the near future may reasonably be expected
to be materially different than its activities of the recent past.34 Current Section 13a of
Rule 4(A) addresses how SLD are treated pursuant to other Rules, particularly Rule 4,
which addresses Members’ deposits to the Clearing Fund. While this proposal would not
change NSCC’s rights with respect to these funds, it would provide Members with
greater transparency into how SLD are treated under Rule 4.
NSCC would also amend the provision in Rule 4(A) that addresses when SLD
would be returned to a Member that ceases to be a participant. Currently, Rule 4(A)
states that SLD are not subject to Section 7 of Rule 4 (which addresses how Required
Fund Deposits are returned to retired Members) and, as such, are returned to retired
Members as otherwise provided for in Rule 4(A).35 Under the proposed Rule 4(A),
34 For example, this may occur when an index rebalancing occurs shortly after a
month-end options expiration period, which could cause an increase in NSCC’s
liquidity exposures.
35 Section 7 of Rule 4 provides that Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund in
the form of cash and securities are returned to retired Members within 30 calendar
days after all of its transactions have settled and obligations have been satisfied.
See supra note 4. 
Page 42 of 79
because NSCC would be able to calculate SLD each Business Day, it would return SLD
on the Business Day following the calculation date. However, while a firm may still
have unsettled activity on the day it retires, NSCC would not be able to collect SLD on
the days following a Member’s retirement. Therefore, NSCC is proposing to amend Rule
4(A) to require that SLD of a retired Member be treated similarly to other cash Required
Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund and be held by NSCC for 30 calendar days after any
of its open transactions have settled and obligations have been satisfied. This proposed
change would protect NSCC from liquidity risks presented by open transactions in the
days following a firm’s retirement and would align the treatment of these funds with the
treatment of Required Fund Deposits of retired Members.
The proposed Rule 4(A) would also simplify the additional miscellaneous
provisions applicable to SLD, which address, for example, NSCC’s right to debit
Members’ accounts at NSCC if a Supplemental Liquidity Provider fails to meet its
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation, and the information NSCC makes available to
Supplemental Liquidity Providers each Business Day regarding SLD calculations. While
the proposed changes would update and simplify these provisions, they would not
significantly alter the structure of these provisions, as described below.
Proposed Changes to Rule 4(A)
The proposal described above would be implemented into the Rules by amending
the current Rule 4(A). The specific changes to implement the proposal are described
below.
Section 1 (Overview). NSCC is proposing changes to Section 1 of Rule 4(A) to
simplify the descriptions by removing outdated and unnecessary language. Section 1 of 
Page 43 of 79
Rule 4(A) would continue to provide the rationale for the SLD requirement, by
describing NSCC’s liquidity needs and how the SLD requirements are designed to
contribute to meeting those needs. However, the proposed changes would simplify this
section by removing a statement that specifically identifies two of NSCC’s principal
sources of liquidity and would instead more generally refer to NSCC’s sources of
liquidity. The proposed changes to Section 1 of Rule 4(A) would also remove references
to options expiration activity periods, which would no longer be applicable to the SLD
requirement under this proposal.
Section 2 (Defined Terms). NSCC is proposing several changes to Section 2 of
Rule 4(A) in order to implement this proposal. As described below, the proposed
changes to the defined terms address the change in timing of the SLD requirement to
occur each Business Day and would improve the transparency of Rule 4(A) through
simplified and clearer defined terms.
First, Section 2 of proposed Rule 4(A) would remove the definition of “Special
Activity Calculation Date,” which is tied to the monthly Options Expiration Activity
Period, and instead would use the term “Business Day” throughout proposed Rule 4(A),
where appropriate. Business Day is currently defined in Rule 1 as any day on which
NSCC is open for business. Therefore, this proposed change would provide for the
calculation of SLD requirements on each day that NSCC is open for business.
Second, Section 2 of the proposed Rule 4(A) revise other defined terms that use
the phrase “Special Activity” to either remove that phrase or, when appropriate, to
replace this phrase with the term “Supplemental.” For example, NSCC would revise the
defined term “Special Activity Daily Liquidity Need” to “Daily Liquidity Need,” and 
Page 44 of 79
would revise the defined term “Special Activity Liquidity Provider” to “Supplemental
Liquidity Provider.” The phrase “Special Activity” was used in the current Rule 4(A) to
refer to the Options Expiration Activity Period, which would only be applicable to the
monthly intraday SLD in the proposed Rule 4(A).
NSCC would also update the definition of Daily Liquidity Need to change a
reference from a four-day settlement cycle to a three-day settlement cycle, to reflect the
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) under the Act to shorten the standard settlement cycle for
most broker-dealer transactions.36 Additionally, NSCC would move the defined term for
“Options Expiration Activity Period” within Section 2 of the proposed Rule 4(A) so it
continues to appear alphabetically, but is not proposing to change the definition of this
term.
Third, the proposed changes to Section 2 of Rule 4(A) would include one defined
term for “Qualifying Liquid Resources” to refer to all default liquidity resources available
to NSCC to settle its payment obligations as a central counterparty. As discussed in
greater detail above, the defined term would provide that NSCC may apply stressed
market assumptions to its Qualifying Liquid Resources when applying these resources in
the calculations made under Rule 4(A). In connection with this proposed change, NSCC
would remove the defined terms “Commitment” and “Credit Facility,” which were used
in the current Rule 4(A) to refer to NSCC’s Line of Credit, and would remove “Other
Qualifying Liquid Resources,” which was used to refer to NSCC’s liquid resources other
than the Clearing Fund and the Line of Credit. This proposed change would simplify
Rule 4(A) and would account for NSCC’s continuing efforts to expand and diversify its
36 See 17 CFR 240.15c6-1. 
Page 45 of 79
default liquidity resources. The proposed change would also clarify that Qualifying
Liquid Resources would not include SLD for purposes of the calculations in Rule 4(A).
Fourth, the proposed changes would move certain calculations out of the defined
terms in Section 2 and include them in the relevant later sections of Rule 4(A). This
proposed change would simplify and clarify Rule 4(A), which currently requires a reader
to refer back to the defined terms in Section 2 when reading the calculations and
requirements set forth in later sections of Rule 4(A). For example, Section 2 of Rule
4(A) currently includes the calculation of “Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposure”
and “Special Activity Peak Liquidity Need.” In the proposed Rule 4(A), NSCC would no
longer use the calculation of Special Activity Peak Liquidity Exposure in determining the
Supplemental Liquidity Providers or in calculating those requirements. The calculation
of Peak Liquidity Need, which would replace Special Activity Peak Liquidity Need,
would be moved out of Section 2 and into Section 3, where that calculation would be
described as being used to identify Supplemental Liquidity Providers.
Finally, the proposed changes to Section 2 of Rule 4(A) would remove defined
terms that are no longer needed when NSCC calculates SLD requirements daily. For
example, NSCC would remove defined terms that are related to the Options Expiration
Activity Period, including “Special Activity Business Day,” which is currently defined as
a Business Day included in an Options Expiration Activity Period. NSCC would also
remove the defined term for “Special Activity Prefund Deposit” because it would no
longer be necessary for Members to prefund their potential SLD requirement in advance
of NSCC’s calculations when they are done on a daily basis. 
Page 46 of 79
Section 3 (Supplemental Liquidity Providers). NSCC is proposing to amend
Section 3 to describe how NSCC would identify the Supplemental Liquidity Providers for
each Business Day. Section 3 of the proposed Rule 4(A) would state that, each Business
Day, NSCC would determine the Peak Liquidity Need of each Member during the
Lookback Period, and would identify the Supplemental Liquidity Providers for that
Business Day as the 30 (or fewer) Members with the largest Peak Liquidity Need in that
time period. These changes would implement the proposal described in greater detail
above to make this calculation daily and to simplify the calculation used to identify
Supplemental Liquidity Providers by using Peak Liquidity Need rather than using the
largest exposures of all providers in the Lookback Period.
Section 4 (Supplemental Liquidity Obligations); Section 5 (Satisfaction of
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations); and Section 6 (Notice of Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations and Payment of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits). NSCC would amend
Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 4(A) to describe the simplified calculation of Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations, and the process by which Supplemental Liquidity Providers would
pay their Supplemental Liquidity Obligations after being notified by NSCC. Proposed
changes to Section 4 would implement the revised calculation of Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations, described in greater detail above, as the difference between a Supplemental
Liquidity Provider’s Daily Liquidity Need for that Business Day and the Qualifying
Liquid Resources available to NSCC on that day. The proposed changes would also
create a subsection b. of Section 4 to describe the optional, alternative pro rata calculation
of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations, as described in greater detail above. 
Page 47 of 79
Proposed changes to Sections 5 and 6 of Rule 4(A) would update the defined
terms and the timing by when Supplemental Liquidity Providers must fund their
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations to reflect the change of these obligations to daily.
Proposed changes to Section 6 of Rule 4(A) would state that the notice provided to
Supplemental Liquidity Providers regarding their Supplemental Liquidity Obligations
would state if that amount was calculated pursuant to Section 4b as a pro rata share of the
largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of that Business Day.
Section 7 (Determination of Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls) and Section 8
(Satisfaction of Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls). NSCC would amend Sections 7
and 8 of Rule 4(A) to reflect the removal of the Special Activity Liquidity Calls and the
adoption of the two Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls, as described in greater detail
above. The proposed changes to these sections would also update defined terms, as
appropriate.
Returns of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits – Section 9 (Deposits Made in
Satisfaction of a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation) and Section 10 (Ceasing to be a
Participant). NSCC is proposing to consolidate the current Sections 9 and 10 of Rule
4(A) into a new Section 9 of Rule 4(A), which would address the return of SLD that are
made in satisfaction of both Supplemental Liquidity Obligations and Intraday
Supplemental Liquidity Calls. The proposed changes would provide that SLD made
pursuant to either Supplemental Liquidity Obligations and Intraday Supplemental
Liquidity Calls would be returned to Supplemental Liquidity Providers on the next
Business Day after the calculation date, unless otherwise notified by NSCC. 
Page 48 of 79
NSCC would amend Section 10 (currently Section 11) to align the treatment of
SLD of a retired Member with the treatment of such firm’s Required Fund Deposits, as
described in greater detail above.
Miscellaneous Matters – Section 11 (Obligations of Affiliated Families and
Supplemental Liquidity Providers), Section 12 (Application of Supplemental Liquidity
Deposits) and Section 13 (Information). NSCC would amend Sections 11, 12 and 13
(currently Sections 12, 13 and 14) of Rule 4(A) to update and simplify these provisions.
The proposed amendments would not substantially amend the purpose or application of
these sections.
Section 11 (currently Section 12) of Rule 4(A) provides that the Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations of Affiliated Families are the several obligations of all of the
Members of the Affiliated Family ratably in proportion to their applicable Special
Activity Peak Liquidity Exposure. NSCC would not change this provision but would
update it to use revised defined terms. NSCC would also amend Section 11 by
consolidating two parallel paragraphs into subsection b., which address NSCC’s right to
collect SLD from Supplemental Liquidity Providers. This proposed change would
simplify the provision but would not make substantive changes to NSCC’s rights or
Members’ obligations.
Section 12 (currently Section 13), which addresses how SLD are treated under
Rule 4, would be amended to update defined terms and to clarify that SLD may be held
by NSCC as part of Members’ actual deposits to the Clearing Fund, pursuant to Section 9
of Rule 4. No substantive changes are proposed to this Section. 
Page 49 of 79
Section 13 (currently Section 14) describes NSCC’s obligation to provide
Members with certain information regarding its SLD calculation. NSCC is proposing to
amend this section to include updated defined terms and to reflect the daily calculation of
SLD.
(iv) Impact Study Results
NSCC has provided the Commission with the results of an impact study that
reviewed the proposal against the observed regulatory liquidity needs and NSCC’s
Qualifying Liquid Resources available during the period from 2016 through 2020 to
assess both pro-forma and hypothetical impacts of the proposal under various liquidity
scenarios.
Pro-Forma Impact Study. The pro-forma impact study compared NSCC’s
regulatory liquidity needs against the Qualifying Liquid Resources that were available
between 2016 and 2020. The pro-forma analysis indicated that NSCC would expect
between 1 and 3 Supplemental Liquidity Obligations per year, ranging in size between
$1.0 billion to $5.4 billion in 2016 through 2019. In calendar year 2020, the impact study
shows that available Qualifying Liquid Resources for each date would have eliminated
potential Supplement Liquidity Obligations.
Additionally, this impact study showed between 4 and 27 actual Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations were received by NSCC per year, typically averaging $3.6 billion
during this same period, including 9 actual Supplemental Liquidity Obligations received
by NSCC in 2020.
Hypothetical Impact Study. NSCC also developed several hypothetical liquidity
scenarios to assess the proposal’s impact. When hypothetical Qualifying Liquid 
Page 50 of 79
Resources available to NSCC are between $17 billion and $22 billion, NSCC would
expect between 7 and 36 Supplemental Liquidity Obligations per year, ranging in size
between $2.1 billion to $4.6 billion each; and (2) when the hypothetical Qualifying
Liquid Resources available to NSCC are $22 billion or above, NSCC would expect
between 1 and 5 Supplemental Liquidity Obligations per year, ranging in size between
$2.1 billion to $6.8 billion each.
NSCC has also provided the Commission with details of potential impacts of the
proposal on the largest 50 Affiliated Families, a list of the 30 Affiliated Families with the
largest liquidity exposures as of December 31, 2020, and the respective Affiliated
Families’ maximum and average NSCC liquidity needs for each calendar year between
2016 and 2020.
(v) Implementation Timeframe
NSCC would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 Business Days
after the later of the approval of the proposed rule change and no objection to the related
advance notice37 by the Commission. NSCC would announce the effective date of the
proposed changes by Important Notice posted to its website.
2. Statutory Basis
NSCC believes the proposed changes are consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a registered clearing agency.
In particular, NSCC believes the proposed changes are consistent with Section
37 Supra note 3. 
Page 51 of 79
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act,38 and Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii), each promulgated under
the Act,39 for the reasons described below.
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of NSCC be designed to,
among other things, assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the
custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible.40 NSCC believes
the proposed rule change is designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds
which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible because the proposal
would allow NSCC to better limit its liquidity exposure to Members in the event of a
Member default.
Specifically, under the proposal, each Business Day NSCC would measure the
Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of each Supplemental Liquidity Provider as the
difference between the Daily Liquidity Need of the Supplemental Liquidity Provider
calculated for that Business Day and the Qualifying Liquid Resources available to NSCC
on that day assuming stressed market conditions. By making these calculations daily
based on Members’ current activity and NSCC’s resources currently available to NSCC,
the proposed SLD requirement would provide NSCC with a more accurate measure of its
potential liquidity exposures to its Members in the event of a Member default. The
proposal would also establish a monthly intraday SLD collection in connection with
options expiration activity that present heighted liquidity exposures, and an optional
intraday SLD that NSCC may collect when it deems appropriate to mitigate any
38 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F).
39 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii).
40 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F). 
Page 52 of 79
increased liquidity exposures or in light of other circumstances. These proposed intraday
SLD would allow NSCC to re-calculate its liquidity exposures and collect sufficient
liquidity to allow it to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a
Member.
Additionally, by providing an alternative pro rata calculation of Supplemental
Liquidity Obligations in certain circumstances, the proposal would provide NSCC with
the flexibility to determine the total amount collected on a Business Day, while
continuing to collect and hold sufficient liquidity to allow NSCC to complete end-of-day
settlement in the event of the default of the Member with the largest payment obligations.
In this way, the proposed change to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD on a
daily basis based on current information, and on an intraday basis when NSCC observes
an increase in its Daily Liquidity Need, would help NSCC assure the safeguarding of
securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible,
consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.41
The proposed changes to simplify and clarify Rule 4(A), which describes the SLD
requirement, would also be consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of
the Act.42 These proposed changes would make the rights and obligations of both NSCC
and its Members under Rule 4(A) more transparent and easier to understand. A clearer
rule supports the ability of Members to meet their obligations to provide NSCC with SLD
when required. The liquidity provided to NSCC through the SLD allows it to complete
end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a Member. Therefore, by making the
41 Id.
42 Id. 
Page 53 of 79
provisions of Rule 4(A) clearer, simpler and more transparent to Members, these
proposed changes also support NSCC’s compliance with the requirements of Section
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in
NSCC’s custody or control or for which it is responsible.43
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) under the Act requires that NSCC establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain
sufficient liquid resources at the minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day
and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a
high degree of confidence under a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that
includes, but is not limited to, the default of the participant family that would generate the
largest aggregate payment obligation for NSCC in extreme but plausible market
conditions.44 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) under the Act requires that NSCC establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
hold qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the minimum liquidity resource
requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) in each relevant currency for which NSCC has
payment obligations owed to its Members.45
As described above, the proposal would strengthen NSCC’s ability to maintain
sufficient liquidity to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a
43 Id.
44 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(i).
45 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii). For purposes of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii),
“qualifying liquid resources” are defined in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) as including, in
part, cash held either at the central bank of issue or at creditworthy commercial
banks. Supra note 7. 
Page 54 of 79
Member. The proposal would do this by allowing NSCC to calculate and collect, when
applicable, SLD every Business Day from those Members that pose the largest liquidity
exposures to NSCC on that day. The proposal would also include a mechanism to allow
NSCC to collect SLD on an intraday basis, including on the first Business Day of the
Options Expiration Activity Period, when liquidity exposures are historically higher.
These resources would be available to NSCC to complete end-of-day settlement in the
event of the default of a Member. Further, SLD are currently, and would continue to be,
held by NSCC at either its cash deposit account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, at a creditworthy commercial bank, or in other investments pursuant to the
Clearing Agency Investment Policy.46 Therefore, SLD would continue to be considered a
qualifying liquid resource, as defined by Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) under the Act,47 and would
support NSCC’s ability to hold qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the
minimum liquidity resource requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i), as required by
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii). Additionally, the proposed alternative pro rata calculation of
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations would provide NSCC with the flexibility to
determine the total amount collected on a Business Day, while continuing to collect and
hold sufficient liquidity to allow NSCC to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of
the default of the Member with the largest payment obligations, as required by Rule
46 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 79528 (December 12, 2016), 81 FR
91232 (December 16, 2016) (File Nos. SR-DTC-2016-007, SR-FICC-2016-005,
SR-NSCC-2016-003); 84949 (December 21, 2018), 83 FR 67779 (December 31,
2018) (File Nos. SR-DTC-2018-012, SR-FICC-2018-014, SR-NSCC-2018-013).
47 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(14). 
Page 55 of 79
17Ad-22(e)(7)(i).48 As such, this proposed change would support NSCC’s ability to hold
sufficient qualifying liquid resources to meet its minimum liquidity resource requirement
under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii).49
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on Burden on Competition
NSCC believes that the proposed rule change could have an impact on
competition. Specifically, NSCC believes the proposed changes could burden
competition because they would require those Members that are identified as
Supplemental Liquidity Providers to make an SLD to the Clearing Fund each Business
Day, when applicable, rather than only monthly in connection with the expiration of
stock options.
Members are currently subject to SLD requirements under Rule 4(A), and, while
the proposed rule change could result in a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on a more
frequent basis, the impact study results, discussed above, show that the proposal would
not have a significant impact on the frequency or amount of those requirements. The
Supplemental Liquidity Obligations of Supplemental Liquidity Providers would be in
direct relation to the specific liquidity exposures presented to NSCC by Members’ daily
activity. Therefore, Members that present the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC,
regardless of the type of Member, currently have, and would continue to have, similar
SLD requirements. The proposed alternative calculation of Supplemental Liquidity
Obligations would provide NSCC with the flexibility to collect and hold sufficient
liquidity to meet NSCC’s regulatory obligations while allocating the Supplemental
48 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(i).
49 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). 
Page 56 of 79
Liquidity Obligations on a pro rata basis among the Supplemental Liquidity Providers for
that Business Day. This proposed change would treat each Supplemental Liquidity
Provider equally when this alternative calculation is triggered.
Therefore, NSCC believes that any burden on competition imposed by the
proposed changes would not be significant and, further, would be both necessary and
appropriate in furtherance of NSCC’s efforts to mitigate risks and meet the requirements
of the Act,50 as described in this filing and further below.
NSCC believes the above described burden on competition that may be created by
the proposed changes to the SLD requirement would be necessary in furtherance of the
purposes of the Act, specifically Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.51 As discussed above,
the proposed change would improve NSCC’s ability to estimate its liquidity exposures in
the calculation and collection of SLD by using daily activity rather than estimating
potential exposures based on activity in a look-back period. In this way, the proposed
change would improve NSCC’s liquidity risk management by supplementing its liquidity
resources that are available to it to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the
default of a Member. The proposed pro rata alternative calculation of SLD would allow
NSCC to opt to collect only the largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation calculated for
that Business Day, while still meeting NSCC’s applicable regulatory obligations. The
proposed enhancements to its liquidity risk management would help NSCC assure the
50 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(I).
51 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F). 
Page 57 of 79
safeguarding of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is
responsible, consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.52
NSCC believes the above described burden on competition that may be created by
the proposed changes to the SLD requirement would be necessary in furtherance of the
purposes of the Act, specifically Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.53 As discussed above,
the proposed change would improve NSCC’s ability to estimate its liquidity exposures in
the calculation and collection of SLD by using daily activity rather than estimating
potential exposures based on activity in a look-back period. The proposal would also
establish a monthly intraday SLD to address the additional liquidity exposures that are
presented by monthly options expiration activity, and an optional intraday SLD that may
be collected when NSCC deems appropriate. In aggregate, the total SLD collected would
improve NSCC’s liquidity risk management by supplementing its liquidity resources that
are available to it to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a
Member. The proposed pro rata alternative calculation of SLD would allow NSCC to opt
to collect only the largest Supplemental Liquidity Obligation calculated for that Business
Day, while still meeting NSCC’s applicable regulatory obligations. The proposed
enhancements to its liquidity risk management would help NSCC assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible,
consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.54

The proposal would strengthen NSCC’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to
complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a Member by allowing
NSCC to collect SLD each Business Day from those Members that pose the largest
liquidity exposures to NSCC on that day. Further, SLD are currently, and would
continue to be, cash deposits to NSCC’s Clearing Fund, which meet the criteria to be
considered qualifying liquid resources, as defined by Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) under the
Act.55 The proposed alternative pro rata calculation would allow NSCC to continue to
collect sufficient liquidity to meet the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i).56 As such,
this proposed change would support NSCC’s ability to hold sufficient qualifying liquid
resources to meet its minimum liquidity resource requirement under Rules 17Ad22(e)(7)(i) and (ii).57
NSCC believes that the above described burden on competition that could be
created by the proposed changes would be appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of
the Act because such changes have been designed to assure the safeguarding of securities
and funds which are in the custody or control of NSCC or for which it is responsible, as
described in detail above. Under both the current Rule 4(A) and the proposed changes to
Rule 4(A), the SLD requirements are designed to require those Members whose
settlement activity pose the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC to provide SLD in the
amount of such exposures. The proposed changes to Rule 4(A) would better support
NSCC by allowing it to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD to address liquidity

exposures that are presented by the activity of Supplemental Liquidity Providers each
Business Day rather than only during monthly options expiration periods. The proposed
rule change would improve NSCC’s ability to measure these liquidity exposures by using
daily activity rather than estimations based on past activity.
Therefore, because the proposed changes are designed to provide NSCC with a
more accurate measure of the liquidity risks presented by Members’ daily activity, NSCC
believes the proposal would meet NSCC’s risk management goals and its regulatory
obligations. NSCC believes that it has designed the proposed rule change in an
appropriate way in order to comply with NSCC’s obligations under the Act. Therefore,
as described above, NSCC believes the proposed changes are necessary and appropriate
in furtherance of NSCC’s obligations under the Act,58 specifically Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
of the Act59 and Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) under the Act.60
(C) Clearing Agency’s Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change
Received from Members, Participants, or Others
NSCC has not received or solicited any written comments relating to this
proposal. NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received by
NSCC.
