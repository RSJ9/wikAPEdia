Hey everyone,

I've built a spreadsheet to track stocks, automatically pull data and analyze fundamentals.

My account didn't have enough *juice* for me to post on here, but now it does!

I fixed a couple of things, so if you already have a copy make yourself a fresh one!

The spreadsheet consists of two sheets:

1.  Tracker: A watchlist to track stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data.

2.  Fundamental Analysis: A way to automatically pull financial statement data, ratios and metrics for analysis.

Everything is automated, the only things you have to change are the tickers and data points you want to pull.

Getting Started:

1.  Open it, go to File and click Make a Copy

2.  Follow all of the instructions on the "Guide" tab

Use the sheet in this way:

1.  Add new tickers to column A of staticData

2.  Sort column A of staticData by A-Z each time you add a new ticker

3.  Add the ticker you want to analyze to A1 of fundamentalAnalysis in UPPERCASE

If you end up adding new rows to Tracker or staticData you'll need to make sure the formulas are applied to each column, do this like you would in Excel, drag the cells down.

If you like the spreadsheet, buy me a coffee! <https://www.buymeacoffee.com/oldworlds>
