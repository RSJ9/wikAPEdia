Reposting this so people can reference my description of the TTM squeeze, this DD checked out, it was just a day too early. Originally Posted 3/4. Check out my NEW POSTÂ <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m0uq9i/gme_price_predictions_38_youre_gonna_like_this/>

Not financial advice, I eat crayons and then spit them in my blender to make crayon smoothies.

Hopefully you guys say this postÂ <https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx4gbv/yall_this_is_statistically_significant_action/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf>Â If you haven't yet give it a read ASAP!

Talking about statistical significance, I found something interesting *technically* speaking. This will be brief but it's pretty exciting shit.

Assuming you don't know indicators, I will be talking about the TTM squeeze. Basically, red dots indicate a squeeze forming, and when the dots go green is when the squeeze fires off. It is one of my favorite indicators to use for trading as it helps to predict the BIG moves in the market.

(If you want a deeper explanation of the indicator, read the following bit. If you understand that red is consolidation and green is the squeeze firing off, you're chillin.)

The TTM Squeeze captures the moments where a market is in a period of consolidation right before a big move and predicts the subsequent direction of that move.

Those red and green dots that run along the middle of the TTM are linked to two underlying indicators you may already be aware of: Bollinger bands and Keltner channels.

When the Bollinger bands are so tight that they are inside the Keltner channels, that means the market is in a period of extreme consolidation and statistically primed for a large move (the squeeze). These periods are symbolized by the red dots on the indicator.

So now that you have a very brief idea of what the TTM squeeze is, allow me to blow your mind.

Below is the $GME chart from mid-late january right before the big run. This is the 4 hr timeframe, notice how the TTM squeeze (the blue bars with red and green dots) was red for 3 days before going green, firing off the beginning of the major run. During that period of consolidation I added 80 shares and boy oh boy am I happy for doing that (don't worry, Idk what a sell button is).

Now look at this. This is GME the past few days.

Look at the TTM squeeze (far right, just beneath the chart, red dots). Today marked day 2 of consolidation on the 4 hour time frame (red dots = consolidation). Given that the price movement is statistically significant (based off DD linked above), tmr marks day 3. We all know what happened last month on day 3 of squeezing on the 4hr...

This could just be a coincidence, but I am a technical trader. This is about a good a setup you can get. Tomorrow gonna be interesting ;)

If you have any questions I'll try my best to answer in the comments, it's been a pleasure holding with you apes!

Obligatory ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

TLDR: if price action really does mimic that of what we saw during the last major run, tomorrow should be the start of an even BIGGER run!

Edit: to clarify, I'm NOT saying GME will hit 100k tomorrow. I'm anticipating the run to 100k to START tomorrow.

Edit 2: thanks for the awards but BUY GME instead ðŸ˜€
