List of fundamentals

1- The price doesn't matter

This is not value investing, it's a short squeeze. I read a post saying 175$ is the floor. This is in line with the revised price target from some analyst. Don't get me wrong, it's a huge upgrade from the previous price target of 10$ per share. But this is in no way the floor. the floor, last I checked, was in the millions. PER SHARE. I will explain further below. Also note that after the squeeze, GME will become an excellent value investment as the transformation of the company is not yet priced in.

2- HODL

This means hold. In non-ape, it means buy the stock and ignore it until we're somewhere in outer-space. The only thing required for the short squeeze to happen is for apes to buy and hold. Repeat as much as you can. Do not day trade, as this negatively affects the rocket launch. Do not buy options as this gives away your positions to market makers like Citadel (our opponent).

3- Do not post your positions

Rookie mistake, we all did it on WSB in the early days. We soon found out that Hedge Funds use algorithms to scrape reddit for all relevant information on our positions. They, on the other hand, do not have to disclose their positions, thus giving them a huge advantage. The less information (about your positions) you post online, the better it is.

4- Do not set sell limits

Market makers have access to this information, they buy it from various trading platforms and you better believe they use it against you. They manipulate the price to trigger sell limits and take your shares away from you. See item 2 above: you need to hold as long as it takes.

5- Do not set dates

I have been guilty myself of setting dates, and this only results in disappointment for myself as well as other apes that read my posts. All we need to do is wait. It costs us absolutely nothing. The squeeze will happen, it is inevitable. Shorts must cover. They have shorted more that 100% of the float. This fact was explicitly written in GME's annual report (10-K).

6- Get yourself some wrinkles

Some of us have been holding for months. I personally bought in in January right before the first mini-squeeze. Smart apes have been unleashing god-tier DD (Due Diligence) at a constant rate from the start, and we pick up more and more smart apes along the way. Do yourself a favor and read the DD.

7- Exit strategy

This is a touchy subject, as the floor gets constantly raised, it is difficult to determine a dollar target for when to sell. After you read the DD, you will understand the mechanics of an infinity squeeze. In short (hehe👀), the price per share will go to infinity as demand is bigger than supply by an extremely wide margin. Last number may have been around 900%, but we do not know for sure. What we do know is that they are desperate for us to sell our shares, and that is why they are manipulating the price in such a blatant way. I will refer you to an excellent DD about exit strategy by the wrinkly-brained [u/WardenElite](https://www.reddit.com/user/WardenElite/) : [Exit Strategy DD: A comprehensive guide to maximizing your gains during the GME short squeeze. Advice from a day and swing trader.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/)

I am copy/pasting the TLDR:

> TLDR; Selling early is bad. Sell on the way down. Look out for triangle patterns and understand how to trade them! Don't sell everything at once, scale out slowly. Try your best to time the peak and know that a telltale sign that you are near the peak is a huge green candle stick before reversing. The peak is not symmetric! The price won't drop immediately back to 40; it should bounce a few times!

basically hold, and the more of us hold, the higher the price gets since we control the supply.

8- Be excellent!

I will repeat what [u/Rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rensole/) says at the end of every one of his daily updates: be kind to each other. In recent days, I have been called a shill on multiple occasions, and I know people are on edge. Shills are definitely among us. Before accusing other apes, look into their post history and their account age. Instead of accusing or telling somebody off, report them to mods who will look into it.

9- Do not lend out your shares

Unbeknown to know, Hedge funds can use your shares for shorting. You need to make sure to have your shares in a cash account, and not in a margin account. Contact your broker to insure that your shares are not being loaned.

This is definitely not financial advice, you do you. This is my personal opinion on how to achieve maximum tendyness.

Apes together strong. See you on the moon you beautiful apes.
